It is basically a company that buys and sells other companies in various industries.  They recently closed 50 million bucks in a public offering, and they bought a few companies and the executive chairman seems pretty bullish cuz he bought a chunk of shares all around the same time.

They have a ton of cash, their Current Ratio is great, their P/E is great.  Their numbers look good to my limited understanding.

The leadership team seems to have swapped over in 2019.  They grabbed the COO from one of their acquisitions, Premier Packaging Corporation, which also seems to be driving a good chunk of their revenue.  Seems that he is working to help the other companies in the portfolio do what he did for the packaging company.  He's the business guy on the leadership team.  The rest seem to be savy financial guys and lawyers.

It really seems like the company did a big transition in 2019 and it sounds like they are making smart plays.  My only concern is that they have issued closed public offerings of common stock 6 times since 2019.  Usually small amounts, like 3 to 6 million, but the last 2 were bigger, 30 and 50 million.

I'll admit, I'm not 100% on what this will eventually mean if I buy.  From my understanding, if I owned stock, my ownership percentage would be diluted, but my share price would stay the same unless normal things happen to lower a share price.  Since I don't really participate in voting or anything, all this means to me is that the company I invested in has more capital, which if the business model is to buy and boost companies, that seems like a good thing.

So, why shouldn't I buy this stock?  What am I being too dumb to see?

\- I have this idea that dividend stocks can often outperform most index funds. You have to know how to pick them, obviously. Is this correct?

\- Can someone share what type of dividend revenue you were able to generate by re-investing over time?

\- How more exposed to lack of diversification is a portfolio that contains only dividend stocks?

**Index funds**

\- A lot of funds I'm looking at cost more than €1000. Is this common for most funds worth investing in? Coca-cola stock, for instance, which pays dividends, can be bought for around €50...

* Investors are seeing the ‘finale to an 11-year bull market’
* Evidence is clear but psychologically difficult to process

&gt;Our main study of bubbles eventually covered 330 examples including commodities. To do this on a consistent basis, we defined a bubble on price series only as a two-sigma event, the kind that would occur randomly every 44 years. (In our data its every 35 years -- pretty close.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Using only price trend and using only outliers seemed, then and now, better than using arbitrary price changes, which can double or triple from extreme lows, like 1931 or 1982, and mean nothing. Yes, we found a few paradigm shifts -- almost all small, such as moving from developing status to developed. None, other than oil in the first OPEC crisis, were significant. All the other major bubbles returned to trend eventually.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the great bubbles by scale and significance, we also noticed that they all accelerated late in the game and had psychological measures that could not be missed by ordinary investors. (Economists are a different matter.) The data, like today, is always clear, just uncommercial and inconvenient for the investment industry and often psychologically impossible to see for many individuals.

I’ve been closely following gold prices for a few months and have seen a lot of discussions around the relationship between inflation and a potential increase in interest rates which would negatively impact gold as investors seek better risk-adjusted yield opportunities in bonds.

Despite interest rate concerns, I still believe gold is a decent hedge since SPY keeps hitting new all-time highs every week. The Fed continues to reassure the market that interest rates won’t move until late 2022 at the earliest. In my opinion, inflation may run hot for the next year giving gold a decent tailwind. I know this is a simple macro overview, but let’s move on to the trade opportunity.

I have noticed recently that Barrick has been lagging its major competitor Newmont this year, why? It already traded at a lower multiple compared to Newmont at the start of the year which makes sense as it has lower operating margins/growth expectations. There doesn’t appear to be an explicit reason for the relative dispersion between the 2 companies’ share price YTD when they have historically been very correlated.

Here are my 2 potential strategies:

#1 Target Price Realization: Go long $GOLD common stock while selling monthly calls 5-10% above purchase price. Current monthly implied volatility shows about 2-3% monthly premium. Not bad. If I get assigned first month, would re-enter.

#2 Pairs Trade: Go long Barrick ($GOLD) and short Newmont ($NEM) until both securities revert to their mean averages of the past 5 years (89% correlation).

In summary, I strongly believe there is a 15-20% short term opportunity here which may not be groundbreaking but still outperforming the broader market if this mean reversion occurs &amp;amp;lt;1 year.

the reason why i ask is, i like to watch sharktank segments once in a while.

However, whenever they go on the show looking for investments, the company valuation seems to be done in such a linear fashion. The main (and seems like ONLY) valuation method the sharks use is simply investment * equity.

and yes, i get that. its true asking for a 100k for 10% equity is the same thing as saying their company is worth $1MM. but what i DONT get is that it seems like thats the only metric everyone on the show is using. any other argument the person seeking investment uses is denied by the sharks.

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)! **Note: I include this in case there are algo-traders here, but neither the code nor the algo is the focal point of this post.** Also, this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a **2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF**. Important to note that not every week is a breakout win (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction on March 4. This algorithm has returned 52%, compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

**Reddit - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Estimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (the text file I store my data in ended up being 55mb -- it’s nothing crazy but it’s quite large for just text)

It seems like, if you’re not sure what you’re doing, diversification makes a 100% sense.

However, there’s a very good argument regarding not to put all eggs in one basket. At the end of the day, most things in life are out of our control and it’s necessary to have as much control as possible hence diversification makes sense in that way.

* **Globally, Nike is seeing shoppers splurge on new sneakers and fashion-forward sweatsuits to wear as more people begin to socialize again.**
* **The company’s Jordan brand has been a particular bright spot.**
* **At least 12 brokerages have already raised their price targets on Nike shares, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter release.**

[Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE) shares surged more than 14% on Friday morning, hitting a record high, after the sneaker maker [forecast full-year sales topping $50 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/nike-nke-q4-2021-earnings.html) as its North American business rebounds from the lows of the coronavirus pandemic.

**And in greater China sales appear to be improving**, with Nike management saying the company is confident about its ability to regain trust with customers there, amid threats to boycott Western brands over their comments expressing concern about alleged forced labor in Xinjiang.

“These are times when strong brands can get stronger, and each quarter this reality becomes even more clear,” Nike Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said during an earnings call Thursday evening.

**Nike’s stock was trading $152.70 at 9:35 a.m. ET. The retailer, which has a market cap of more than $211 billion, last saw its stock hit an all-time high of $147.95 on Dec. 21.**

**Globally, Nike is seeing shoppers splurge on new sneakers and fashion-forward sweatsuits to wear as more people begin to socialize again. The company’s Jordan brand has been a particular bright spot.**

**During the three-month period ended May 31, Nike’s total revenue nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from $6.31 billion a year earlier, topping Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion. In North America, Nike’s biggest market, sales more than doubled to a record $5.38 billion.**

Following Nike’s upbeat fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, Cowen &amp; Co. analyst John Kernan raised his price target to $181 from $145. Kernan said he sees a path for the company’s market cap to one day surpass $300 billion.

“Management’s confidence is hitting an inflection and Q4 results indicate the digitally driven acceleration in the financial model,” he said in a note to clients.

According to Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández, Nike is benefiting from its closer connections with customers through its membership program, higher full price selling, greater use of data and a smarter wholesale model with strong partners like [Foot Locker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FL).

Telsey raised its price target on Nike shares to $180 from $160.

“The strong momentum in Nike’s brand globally is more than offsetting pressure in China and supply chain constraints,” Fernandez said in a note to clients.

At least 12 brokerages have already raised their price targets on Nike shares, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter release. According to FactSet, the median target price of analysts who cover the company is now $176.90.

“The company is emerging from the Covid period into the biggest \[profit and loss\] evolutions in our coverage universe,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said.

Nike warrants “a significant valuation premium” compared with other global apparel and footwear brands, he added.

1624650510.0|0.0|t3_o7v26u|6.0|"I believe I understand the following:

* NAV is the sum of a companies assets; represents the value if the company was liquidated
* Market Cap is (shares outstanding x share price) and represents the markets perceived value (today + future value)

The former straightforward, its the latter that confuses me, mainly when it comes to commodities (i.e. copper).

If we look at a company like Amazon, it makes sense that the share price, representing how much an investor is willing to pay for 1 piece of Amazon, would be higher than Amazons NAVPS. Amazon may build a sever system and have proprietary software that has a fixed worth of $200M (fake number). Assuming Amazon had 100M shares outstanding, it's reasonable to assume that Amazon shares would trade higher than $2/share because Amazon generates revenue from server compute time, server space and licensing their software. This is the ""future value"" baked into Amazon's market cap and share prices.

But how does this apply to a copper miner? They have a mineral resource that has a valuation (a feasibility study) at a certain price and its applied to, giving their resource a Net Present Value with a Discount Rate (generally 8%). For simplicity, lets assume their statements say the NPV8 of their copper deposit is $300M. When they contract out their supply of copper, the value for which they are going to get is known and the resource is finite, so unlike Amazon they don't have the potential to generate revenue year over year without depleting the deposit.

So why would a mining company have a market cap beyond the value of their finite resource?"|investing|Market Cap, NAV and Miners|6.0|0.7

Articles that mention Grayscale Trust reference its 2% fee and $50,000 minimum, which are extraordinarily high for any typical market offering right now (obviously, BTC and other digital currencies aren’t “typical” investments by any means, but the opportunity cost of whatever I invest in GBTC is likely a total market fund like FZROX).

**TLDR;**

""The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can help smaller investors determine what the ""smart money"" is doing in the market. However, studies have found that 13F filings also have serious flaws and can't be taken at face value.""

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns SP500(1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-a-market-correction-coming/) 

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

Anyways so recently i have came across this opportunity of something called a Carbon Credit. So what is this and how does it work? 

A Carbon Credit is the value of 1 ton of Carbon, they hold their value and cannot go under the price you’ve bought them for from my understanding. These carbon credits are purchased from private(voluntary) and/or public bond markets. We will go over what the differences between the two are and the opportunity that lays beneath both.

Where do they come from and how are they priced? 

These Carbon credits are purchased from individuals that have green projects for example “prices for community-based clean cookstoves projects, which often deliver life-saving health benefits to women and children, are generally higher than, for example, large-scale renewable energy projects. But they ultimately yield to the forces of supply and demand” 

This means the price of these credits vary  [Valuation ](https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/screen_shot_2016-06-13_at_2.20.18_pm.png) you are basically funding carbon neutral projects. Or allowing corps to help become carbon neutral in a capitalism approach.

These credits have been around for some time although mass adoption is slowly coming as we have to save the earth from the pollution and degrading emissions. What will happen is if companies start to increase their carbon footprint there will be a tax from the government. Which is good fcf that could have been filtered into the business. Adoption has occurred between many Fortune 500 companies such as Apple, IBM, jp Morgan, Disney, ect. It is a supply and demand thing the more supply the easier it is for companies to buy these credits with a growing demanding in the thesis as one goes up the other does. We are in a relatively young phase but are on the verge of kickstarting this campaign. As carbon emissions start to go up. In a forecast from the OCED these carbon emissions are said to increase by 58% by 2030. This is a bullish statement for the future of carbon credits and a bit of a scary reality for the environment.  

This is a multi trillion dollar asset class that is relatively new. If anyone has any insight or can point out any mistakes I would like to hear your thoughts on this topic. No more picking up cans we are changing the world.

I recently found what I think is a solid company to invest in. Freedom Holding Inc. (FRHC) is, in essence, a brokerage business. I don't know if you guys have read the news lately, but brokerage businesses have been doing well for themselves lately, and FRHC financials reflect that. 

Revenues have risen from $120m in 2020 to $349m in 2020, with estimates saying the company can achieve $588m revs in 2022. Operating profit has risen from $38.4m in 2020 to $197m in 2021. The company has taken advantage of these fundamentals and has significantly increased its cash position which has risen from $63.2m in 2020 to $699m in 2021 through what I understand to be primarily a mix of cash from operating activities ($565m in 2021) and cash from issuing debt ($348m in 2021).

Margins look solid too. Their operating margin has remained steadily above 30% since 2017, with their 2021 operating margin being at 56.4%. ROCE and ROE metrics seem relatively stable as well, averaging at 25.54% and 29.35% since 2017, respectively.

From a technical point of view, the stock seems to have bounced from recent highs and might continue upward.

Tom Brady rookie cards. They are not cheap, and that’s fantastic news. They’re cheap now compared to the future value. 

Look up “The Man in the Arena”, it’s a documentary about each one of Brady’s Super Bowl trips, 10 episodes. Coming out around November. It’s being produced by the same people who did “The Last Dance”. 

Not just that, but look at the Bucs schedule this season. One of the easiest out there. The AFC East and the NFC East. C’mon, they’ll be like 13-4. 

Prices will be insane starting just around the corner, playoff time. 

He’s so safe compared to all these prospects that never do anything and ultimately lose value. 


If someone spent a lot on Brady rookie cards now, the value the day he retires will be insane. He’s not retiring until at least two more seasons, so that’s why I know it’s not too late. For example, when he retires, that’s a horrible time to buy them, but obviously the demand and prices will both be high.

Prices are lower in the off season, and here we are. When the Man in the Arena is going on, with the Bucs winning games left and right, what do you think prices are going to do?


So that’s what I think, best part is that it’s all true. 

Think about Babe Ruth cards, or Jordan rookies etc. think about how recent Brady rookie (2000) cards are compared to other guys of the past that are selling for ridiculous amounts, and Brady had had a better career than many of them

$100,00 spent on Brady rookies now will be with at least $500,000 the day he retires. It’s so obvious! Super safe, name one reason that the value will be down between now and then? There’s no such thing as the “sports card market”, value is based off of the individual player. The card, year, serial number or not, signed or not, graded or not, the grade etc. New guys never accomplishing anything and their value going down is just common sense

Here is the ONLY* way to play the pick and shovel side of the rapidly growing sports gambling segment: Genius Sports **$GENI**

*edit* *Competitor Sportradar is in process of traditional IPO but no date has been set. They had a failed merge with a SPAC recently most likely due to the high valuation and in my opinion the loss of the NFL contract. If the IPO is at a decent valuation this will be another good play on the picks and shovels part of sports gambling. GENI and Sportradar have a duopoly on the market.

Genius Sports is the official data, technology and commercial partner that powers the global ecosystem connecting sports, betting and media.

They are the trusted partner to over 400 sports organizations globally, capturing the highest quality data for many of the world’s largest leagues and federations such as the NFL, EPL, FIBA, NCAA, NASCAR, AFA and PGA.

Not only are they partners with the sports leagues, they are partners with the 300 of the world’s largest sportsbooks brands, and media outlets:

**Sports:** NFL, NBA, Premier League, NCAA, Football Data Co, FIBA, Euroleague Basketball, PGA

**Betting:** Bet365, Flutter, William Hill, Betway, Draftkings

**Media:** NFL, CBS All Access, Pizza Hut, Michigan Lottery, MLB, POINTSBET, FanDuel, BETMGM, Caesers Sportsbook, Volvo


Not only are they partnered with the NFL but **$GENI** won the exclusive distribution rights for NFL official data in April. They beat out their only main competitor, Sportradar. In addition to data rights, the partnership includes adjacent agreements such as video streaming rights to international (non-US) sportsbooks. $GENI will also support the NFL’s data collection and advertising capabilities while also helping monitor suspicious activity to maintain integrity.

This exclusive deal validates Genius Sports competitive position as a core cog in the global sports betting industry, where global sportsbook operators rely on data feeds distributed by **$GENI**

1st Quarter Earnings $GENI reported 1st quarter earnings on May 20th and raised full year 2021 revenue guidance by 35%

-Q1 revenue increased 52% year-over-year to $53.7m

-First quarter group Adj. EBITDA up 414% year-over year to $9.3m (net loss of $5.3m)

-Raised FY2021 group revenue guidance from $190m to $250m-$260m

-Announced a six-year strategic partnership with the National Football League

-Entered into a two-year marketing partnership with FanDuel to deliver data-driven, targeted advertising

-Announced the acquisitions of two leading technology companies, FanHub and Second Spectrum, diversifying our offering and enhancing capabilities

-Appointed sports industry leader and former Turner President, David Levy, as Genius Sports’ new Chairman. GROWTH

Gross Gaming Revenue expected to nearly double from $31B in 2020 to $59B by 2025 (via H2 Gambling Capital). These numbers do not include Canada who just passed a federal bill to legalize sports gambling across the country – Consider Canada as a second California for population.

**$GENI** looks to take advantage of this with 120% EBITDA growth CAGR from 2020-2022.

**$GENI** has also proven their growth over the past several years: $88m in 2018, $115m in 2019, $149.7m in 2020. As previously stated they have increased their 2021F from $190m to $250-$260m, already surpassing their 2022F of $238M.


**MOAT**

**$GENI** is the leading exclusive content and data provider for data acquisition and data monetization:

-They are the mission critical supplier to sports betting operators

-Provide exclusive, official data to sports betting operators worldwide with risk management and trading solutions

-They acquire exclusive, official rights to sports data from major leagues and federations

**$GENI** is one of two players (and the only publicly traded one for now) of scale providing full-service provision: # of events covered, # of sports covered, Sport League Services, One stop shop betting services, media solutions, Streaming solutions.

Their Technology and scale provide high barriers to entry:

-1500 employees across 6 continents

-450 employees in technology and trading

-7,000 statisticians and agents

-650+ long term partnerships with sports and sportsbooks

-$110m+ invested in proprietary technology

-Their technology exchange for rights means **$GENI** becomes fully embedded and hard to replace (150+ integrations)

-Analyze risk and manage markets, probabilities and results for 240k+ events every year

-Highly customizable software to manage every aspect of a sportsbook’s data and trading offering: outsourced sports wagering at scale


**OFFICIAL DATA**

**$GENI** has the feed of live sports statistics that is sanctioned by the sports for collection and distribution (BIG DEAL).

Why that matters:

Matters to sports – it goes to the very heart of their funding

Matters to sportsbooks – only official data gives them the security of the supply they need

Matters to regulators – protects consumers

Matters to investors – the cost of sports data is built into their model, contributing to our high barriers to entry

Anecdotal: Genius Sports is so important to Draftkings that it is listed in their risk factors



**Coverage**

**$GENI** has been covered by a handful of analysts who have all given this a buy rating with PTs in the high 20’s and low 30s:

Goldman Sachs: $31

Craig Hallum: $30

Needham &amp; Co: $28

Benchmark: $33

Oppenheimer: $32

As of writing this, the stock is trading at $19.40. Still a huge discount to the price targets above. Part of this discount is **$GENI** recently had an upsized stock offering of 22 million shares. While the market reacted negatively, Oppenheimer came out and reiterated their PT of $32 as they saw this as a positive for the company to raise cash to continue to acquire companies that complement their offerings. Most recently they acquired Second Spectrum (Augmented reality and tracking technology backed by Steve Ballmer), and Fanhub (free to play games).



TLDR: **$GENI** is the the pick and shovel data provider to all the favorite sports betting books including $DKNG, and the only publicly traded sports betting data provider in one of the fastest growing segments in the US market. With a huge moat, Exclusive partnership with the NFL, and partnerships with hundreds of other sports leagues and sports betting books why try picking a winner when you can invest in the data provider that supplies them all?



*Edit* It was also brought to my attention I was lacking bear cases. The only bear case I can think of is that GENI overpaid for the NFL contract. My rebuttal is while Sportradar had it from 2015 to 2020, they were not able to take full advantage of sports gambling revenue as it was not prominent or legal in most states. This is rapidly changing and GENI has built in 5% of revenue from any sports book that uses their data. As gambling continues to grow so will Genius Sports revenue. Another element of the partnership with Genius Sports gives the company the right to distribute live audiovisual game feeds to sportsbooks in international markets, while it will also represent the NFL’s legalized sports betting advertising inventory across the league’s owned and operated digital platforms domestically and internationally.

These aspects along with great exposure for the company via the NFL and Genius Sports ability to entrench their technology into the leagues technology make this deal worth it IMO albeit the high price tag.

If you have any other bear cases that I have not thought of please comment below."|investing|Genius Sports $GENI- Picks &amp; Shovels for Sports Gambling|174.0|0.84

The name of the Stock is  TELEC trading on the Prague stock exchange.

Also, the buy-off is for a very unfair price and obviously, I don't like it because I'll lose some money not much but the loss is a loss and as a long term investor I don't like to sell in red.

The Commodities: Copper (&amp; Au/ Mo), Rare Earth Metals, Helium, and Renewable Diesel.

With an economic recovery underway and some structural changes that effect supply/demand dynamics in certain markets I think it is prudent to have some commodity exposure. I am of the opinion that a period of strong economic growth is ahead (both in NA and globally) and am bullish in general on markets. These are the companies I like for commodity exposure.

Disclosure: I own a position in all four companies discussed in this post. From largest to smallest: DME, CMC, MP, FCX. Please note my risk tolerance may be much different from yours and to make note of the market capitalizations and revenues to evaluate the risks.

**DME.V**

* Desert Mountain Energy Corp. TSXV: DME. OTC: DMEHF. [https://desertmountainenergy.com](https://desertmountainenergy.com)
* Helium exploration. Production and refining expected to begin Q4 2021
* Developing a +85,000 acre helium project in the Holbrook Basin, Northern Arizona. The Holbrook Basin has the highest helium (He) grades in the world. Historic production of helium gas – 9.23 Bcf – ranging from 8% to 10% He
* Market Cap: 288.16M CAD
* 2020 Revenue: 0
* Helium is irreplaceable in many high tech applications and there is a global shortage
* He prices are soaring, with a 135% increase in the price of crude helium over the past 12 months
* DME is building a solar farm to power its processing/refining facilities (\~270 days of sun in Arizona).
* Along with helium (He), rare earth gases found include: neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)
* Significant helium percentages in two wells in Arizona (they have only drilled 3)
   * In the 10-1 well
      * Flow rate of 24,214 MCFGPD (thousand cubic feet gas per day). The average gas analysis showed Helium 7.1321%, Nitrogen 77.0837%, CO2 4.0183% Methane 2.6512% and other assorted minor gases.
   * In the 16-1 well
      * Flow rate of 1,251.2 MCFGPD. The average gas analysis showed Helium 4.0904%, Nitrogen 90.2742%, CO2 0.0063%, Methane 3.5535% and other assorted minor gases.
* Low percentages of carbon based gases (CO2, CH4) means lower refining costs as the nitrogen gas can be vented during the refining process whereas carbon gasses cannot be vented or flared due to environmental regulations.
* Estimates of the costs to extract the helium vary. The lowest I have seen is $65/MCF. HeliumOne has stated refining costs of $20/MCF. Total production costs are likely in the $100/MCF range.
* Refined helium prices range from $1100USD/MCF to $3500USD/MCF! On the low end ($1100) its 99.5% He and at the high end its 99.9995% He.
* There is going to be a lack of supply of helium once the US Bureau of Land Management holds their last auction of their helium reserves in September (this reserve was established in 1925).
* DME is currently drilling a fourth well with plans to drill 3 wells this summer (wells 4, 5, and 6 for the company).
* Construction of the fully funded processing/refining facility to begin this summer. Production expected to begin in Q4 2021.
* A large advantage for DME is their proximity to their customers. The company had planned on purchasing a fleet of vehicles to deliver their helium, but have reached an agreement with their customers to have them come pick it up. This saves the company $7 million in vehicle costs and they will not suffer the loss during transport. Driving from Arizona to Texas in the middle of summer would account for an \~18% loss
* The company has no debt, is fully funded through 2021, and has no plans for future dilution. Currently there are 70M shares outstanding with another \~10M shares in warrants and options outstanding.
* Desert Mountain Energy Corp. (TSX.V – DME) is a forward-looking resource company actively engaged in the exploration and development of Helium and Rare Earth Gas properties in the U.S. Southwest, with its executive offices in Vancouver, Canada. Currently, the company holds +85,000 acres land in Arizona, the world’s best address for Helium.

**CMC.V**

* Cielo Waste Solutions Corp. TSXV: CMC. OTC: CWSFF [https://www.cielows.com](https://www.cielows.com)
* Cielo has developed a proven and patented technology in conjunction with a related party, which will produce a high cetane, ultralow sulfur renewable diesel, kerosene and naphtha fuels. Feedstock for the facility is the world’s most available and inexpensive feedstock of household, commercial and construction/demolition garbage, including feedstocks of Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”) and cellulosic materials such as wet organics (compost), all plastics, paper, tires, cardboard, sawdust and wood.
* Market Cap: 431.33M CAD
* 2020 Revenue: 0
   * Commercial production expected to begin at the Aldersyde, AB facility next month.
* Begins trading on the TSX Venture exchange today (previously traded on the CSE)
* Many governments require diesel to have a certain % of renewable or clean fuel blended into it.
   * In Canada the federal requirement is \~2% and but each province has their own policy (see Q5 in link).
   * USA: The Renewable Fuel Standard is a federal program that requires transportation fuel sold in the country to contain 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel blended into gasoline or diesel by 2022.
   * European Union: fuel suppliers are required to reduce carbon-intensity by 6% for transportation fuels supplied to the EU. This requirement is integrated with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive. Both policies require Member States to enforce targets.

* Cielo facilities can transform most household and industrial waste that currently goes to landfill into valuable diesel fuel. Our facilities operate with virtually no emissions and we can help greatly reduce methane emissions from landfills, as well as reduce reliance on imported biofuels made from agricultural products.
   * Cielo’s process is referred to as Thermal Catalytic Depolymerization (TCD). Waste materials are liquified in the reactor with green power and blended with our proprietary catalyst. The catalyst causes an instant reaction and forms a distillate which is then distilled further into renewable transportation diesel, kerosene (jet/marine fuel) and naphtha.
* One Page Overview: [https://www.cielows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/One-pager-June-24-2021.pdf](https://www.cielows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/One-pager-June-24-2021.pdf)
   * Scalable Modular Model. Cielo has developed a simple modular “plant” manufacturing system. Each “plant” can produce 4,000 liters per hour or 32 million liters per annum. This format allows for multiple “plants” to be built based on feedstock supply at each facility site. This also allows Cielo to build in more remote locations and eliminate many transportation issues/costs.
   * Economics. Each “plant” costs approximately $50 million to build. Pay back on the capital investment is approximately $28 million annually based on EBITDA.
   * Facility Buildout. In addition to the pilot/test facility in Aldersyde, Cielo also plans to complete one corporate facility and one JV facility by end of year 2023. With all three plants operating at full capacity Cielo expects to see revenues of approx. $125 million in 2023, with expected EBIDTA of approximately $70 million.
   * Additional Facility Builds. Cielo expects to build at least 1-2 corporate facilities over the next 24 months in addition to another 1-2 JV facilities. With 5-7 facilities in operation Cielo expects to realize in excess of $350M in revenue and almost $200 million in profits.
* Cielo will, with its planned 40 locations in the next 5-7 years, divert annually approximately 3.9M tonnes of waste, creating approximately 1.3 B liters of renewable fuel making us one of the fastest growing ESG companies in the world.
* Cielo’s renewable diesel costs $0.56-0.61/litre to produce and sells for $1.67 in Alberta. That is a gross margin of 63.4%. This cost is expected to decline with scale.
* Cielo's 1st commercial facility is now operating and producing high grade renewable fuels in Aldersyde, Alberta
   * Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE: CP) supplying scrap railroad ties for 4,000 lph green facility for Medicine Hat.
   * Mountainview Eco Products supply wood waste and preparing alternative feedstocks for the Aldersyde Facility."|investing|Four commodities and a publicly investable option for each one|15.0|0.75

Usually, I am not one to make posts in a sub like this, but I felt compelled to speak my mind on this topic and see if others feel the same.

As a preface, I work in accounting (CPA) and enjoy researching market and macroeconomic trends. The semiconductor industry has caught my eye since the beginning of the COVID-19 shutdown. Ever since, I have conducted a good deal of research on the industry. As part of this process I have identified some major players that I believe are worthy investment opportunities for the near/long-term. TSM may be at the top of that list. 

Over the course of my research, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) has stood out above the rest, in terms of its impact on the global economy. I have read several news articles, analyst reports, and company filings as part of the research process. I believe the best article that explains the immense power of the firm comes from the WSJ. I encourage everyone to read the article, whether you know about TSM or not. It is a great read for new and seasoned investors alike. ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=article\_relatedinline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=article_relatedinline))

In order to be as brief as possible, I have listed some highlights that lured me onto the conclusion that TSM will prove to be one of the world's most powerful and influential businesses, especially during the COVID-19 recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

* TSM is the largest ""fab"" shop by a long shot (They produce 92% of sophisticated chips &amp; 60% of less-sophisticated chips worldwide)
* Enormous cost of capital requirements make it nearly impossible for new entrants to join the industry and eat away at market share
* The global chip shortage has left government's scrambling for reliance on fabs which has lead to large sums of funding
* TSM has enormous production capacity and technical know-how compared with its peers
* TSM serves as a political barrier for the nation of Taiwan (i.e. if China tries to disrupt the Taiwanese political structure, this will lead to shutdowns in TSM manufacturing, thus circumventing the Chinese economy which heavily relies on chips)
* Operational efficiencies - AKA:  Economies of scale (Do I even have to say anymore here?)
* Low levels of debt in comparison to its competitors
* Strong sales growth expected to continue for the next 3 - 5 years to catch up with demand for products that currently have shortages (i.e. Automotive industry)
* TSM is currently at a favorable valuation price compared with its peers (at least in my opinion)
* New technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), high performance computing (HPC), autonomous, and robotics, will increase reliance on TSM
* TSM will be able to pass increasing material costs onto its customers, due to the heightened demand for chips (Further reading if you would like: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?page=1))

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the above points helped communicate my thesis in a clear manner. I truly believe that TSM will continue to be regarded as one of the most powerful companies in the world for the foreseeable future, especially during the global COVID-19 recovery. I encourage anyone to discuss this topic further in order to keep the conversation going. What are your thoughts on my TSM stance? Are there other companies that you believe will be ultra-powerful in a post-COVID world? Please comment!

In this proposition, there is a roughly 60% allocation (the exact numbers aren't super important) to a leveraged market ETF such as UPRO, and a 40% allocation to an equally leveraged treasury ETF such as TMF. This strategy has been used by a number of folks to great success, and has been backtested to work quite well as well, overcoming volatility decay to outperform the underlying index over time. 

Obviously, the drawback of the leveraged ETF is that in case of a crash or correction, it will suffer a severe drawdown - however, this is countered by the treasury holdings, which historically have a negative beta with respect to the market. So the treasury ETF can be thought of as a hedge, and historically it has been an effective hedge. However, I understand that when interest rates go up, treasuries broadly go down. And the market has been jumpy lately (see late 2018) about any rate increases; there is reason to suspect a panic may ensue when rates are increased. But if there is a panic (and crash in equities) due to rate increases, would treasuries then increase in value, or decrease?

What do you think? Will treasuries continue to be negatively correlated with equity even in the event of a crash/panic caused by interest rates? Will they still be an effective hedge on a Hedgefundie-style investment going forward?"|investing|Robustness of treasuries as hedges on a PSLDX/Hedgefundie style investment|3.0|0.58
1624496271.0|0.0|t3_o6q5vv|31.0|"So from what I understand, the current rotation from cyclicals into growth is due to worries that, when the Fed raises rates sometime in 2022/2023/2024, that will lead to the economy cooling off, which therefore hurts cyclicals, who usually thrive in a booming economy but not in a cooling one. Therefore, investors are buying growth now and selling cyclicals in anticipation, since growth performs better during a cooling economy. Add to this the belief by some that we're already in 'peak reopening', meaning that pent up demand likely eases from here, and you can start seeing why a rotation might happen. However, the underlying assumptions of a cooling economy and peak reopening are completely nonsensical in my view. This rotation makes absolutely no sense to me, and I'd love it if someone can tell me why I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We are nowhere near 'peak reopen'. Concerts haven't even begun in earnest, international travel is still nascent, many cities still have capacity limits and restrictions in place, people are still getting vaccinated, half of America is still social distancing. We spent 12-14 months laying at home, but suddenly folks are thinking we're at peak reopen after barely being halfway-reopened for a couple months? New York City, for example, hasn't even fully reopened yet. We have a long way to go before we reach peak reopening pent up demand, and companies that benefit from the reopening still have significant earnings to make before they begin to slow down. Heck, airlines are starting to cancel flights because of the huge levels of demand, and we're worried this demand is gonna start cooling so soon? We have no data or evidence to think this.
2. Projections are that the Fed raises rates by 0.5% by 2023. Why do we think raising rates 0.5% or so will dramatically cool the economy?  The economy is booming because of pent up demand, and we are seeing no signs of it slowing down. Yes, a marginally more hawkish Fed may cool the economy slightly, but this Fed would still be extremely dovish compared to normal times, even if it is not peak dovish. Rates would still be much lower than they were in 2019. At interest rates still below &lt;1% by 2023 based on projections, whatever 'cooling' occurs will likely be minimal, and again this rate increase is still at least 1-2 years away at least. We're really pricing in a 'cooling' economy a full 1-2 years early based on a minimal interest rate hike despite seeing no signs of it cooling yet nor having an exact timeline for rate hikes, while we're just starting the reopening?
3. A ton of these growth stocks have insane valuations. If our fears are due to increased interest rates, are we not at all worried that these high valuations will likewise come down? You've got companies trading at 20-30x sales booming, ironically due to fears of increased interest rates, while companies at 15x P/E that aren't even at their pre-COVID levels sell off. Makes no sense to me.

**The ""redeemable at 2.25"" is the important part.**

Other things to note:

- As time of writing this post, GOED call options for $2.50 out to 2022 is priced the *same* as the warrants
- The warrants are immediately redeemable at 2.25 and are good all the way out to 2025 


This means there's an immediate play to be made:

- Purchase as many GOED warrants as you can 
- Sell covered calls against those GOED warrants

The implication being:

- The covered calls you're selling are immediately profitable (2.5 vs 2.25 premium = $0.25 profit) even after exercising
- Because the calls are priced the same as the warrants, you're not losing *any* money on setting up this play

I have come across this quote ""diversification is for idiots"" from Mark Cuban, and I know Warren Buffett has said in the past that intelligent investors don't need a diversified portfolio. Now I've also come across advice advocating for diversification, and in the past have found myself investing in companies for the sake of diversification and not necessarily my belief in the company. I have realized that what I'm looking for in a company is found most in the technology and finance sectors, and so that is what most of my portfolio has become.

If you're wondering, this is my current portfolio:

* MA
* SOXX
* MSFT
* QFIN
* GOOGL
* FINV
* CROX
* MCO
* PYPL

I have been reading books on investing, especially on Warren Buffett's strategies--investing in good financials with a wide moat. As said before, mainly financial and tech stocks fit my standard for this, and I see it as unwise to invest in other companies purely for the sake of diversification. I'd rather invest in a few companies that I truly believe in. It's riskier, I know, but such risk is mitigated by my standard for the stock. Obviously I do not have much experience investing, so I cannot for sure know that this method is better (at the end of the year I plan to benchmark my returns against a total market etf like VTI to evaluate the method).

Single-game sports betting is set to become legal in Canada after Bill C-218, the Safe and Regulated Sports Betting Act, was [officially passed](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;billId=10866122) in the Senate of Canada on Tuesday.

The private member's bill - sponsored by Conservative MP Kevin Waugh (Saskatoon-Grasswood) - passed without amendment, by a vote of 57 to 20 (five abstentions). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will decide on a date when the legalization of single-game sports betting will take effect.

The bill signals a major shift in Canada: single-game sports betting has been legal in the country but only via parlay wagers. Canadians will now have the ability to bet on single-game matches across sports (excluding horse racing), with the government set to collect taxes on estimated billions of dollars currently being wagered illegally.

Waugh issued a [statement](https://kevinwaugh.ca/mp-waugh-statement-on-passage-of-single-sports-betting-bill-in-the-senate/) Tuesday evening celebrating the passage of the bill, calling it ""a victory for Canadian sport, sport fans, and businesses."" He added:

&gt;Following this legislation becoming law, provincial governments will be responsible for implementing regulations and wagering operators in their jurisdictions.

""I want to see the survival of movie theaters. I want the theatrical experience to remain relevant in our culture,"" he told [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/business/media/steven-spielberg-netflix-academy-awards.html) in 2019.

**But in a clear sign of the times, Spielberg's company, Amblin Partners, announced Monday it has signed a multiyear deal to make feature films annually for the streaming powerhouse Netflix.**

Amblin, named for a 1968 short film by Spielberg, will continue to make movies for Universal Pictures. In recent years, Universal distributed high-profile Amblin projects such as ""Green Book"" and ""1917."" (Universal Pictures is a unit of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)

“At Amblin, storytelling will forever be at the center of everything we do, and from the minute Ted and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,” Spielberg said in a statement Monday, referring to Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix.

**The agreement does not specifically mention that Spielberg will direct movies for Netflix, although** [**Variety said that was a possibility**](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/steven-spielberg-netflix-amblin-deal-1235001513/)**.** Spielberg's next project is a remake of the classic musical ""West Side Story"" that will debut theatrically in December via the Disney-owned label 20th Century Studios.

**The deal represents a major victory for Netflix, which needs A-list talent on its roster to fend off growing competition from streaming rivals such as Disney Plus and grow its base of more than 200 million global subscribers. The pact also signals that Spielberg's alleged feud with Netflix has cooled — or perhaps that the rift was overstated in the first place.**

**In early 2019, Spielberg was reportedly** [**looking to propose rule changes**](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/awards/doj-oscars-potential-new-netflix-rules-could-be-issue-n990151) **that would bar movies that are mainly distributed on digital platforms from competing at the Academy Awards. The reports created the impression that the Oscar-winning director was anti-streaming.**

**But in the end, the celebrated filmmaker behind ""Schindler's List"" and ""Jurassic Park"" did not urge the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revise its eligibility policies. He eventually clarified his views to The New York Times, saying that while he believed in the power of the big-screen experience, he was ultimately agnostic on the question of where people watch entertainment.**

“Big screen, small screen — what really matters to me is a great story and everyone should have access to great stories,"" he said in an email to the newspaper.

""However, I feel people need to have the opportunity to leave the safe and familiar of their lives and go to a place where they can sit in the company of others and have a shared experience — cry together, laugh together, be afraid together — so that when it’s over they might feel a little less like strangers,"" he added.

Netflix debuts most of its original films online, but certain projects directed by big-name auteurs have received limited theatrical engagements lasting a week or more, including Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" and Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story,"" both released in 2019.

The boundaries traditionally separating the theatrical experience and on-demand streaming became increasingly blurred during the Covid-19 pandemic. Warner Bros. Pictures decided to release all its 2021 titles simultaneously in theaters and on the streaming service HBO Max, including upcoming blockbusters such as ""Dune"" and the fourth installment in the ""Matrix"" series.

Spielberg and Netflix technically worked together during the pandemic on the Aaron Sorkin drama ""The Trial of the Chicago 7."" The film, co-produced by Amblin, was sold to Netflix by Paramount Pictures after the coronavirus shuttered movie theaters across the U.S. (Amblin has also co-produced television content for Netflix and other streamers, including the horror anthology series ""The Haunting."")

“Steven is a creative visionary and leader and, like so many others around the world, my growing up was shaped by his memorable characters and stories that have been enduring, inspiring and awakening,"" Sarandos said in a statement Monday. ""We cannot wait to get to work with the Amblin team and we are honored and thrilled to be part of this chapter of Steven’s cinematic history.”

So my main objective is to try and generate minimum 3% p.a. from stock market.

For that I intend to use following strategy:

Sell VOO PUT (Cash secured) - Expiry 16th July - Strike Price 370 - Premium 2

\- If price remains above 370 on expiry then I make 0.54% in 24 days. Then repeat this strategy for next month expiry.

\- If price goes below 370  on expiry then my cost will be 368 and I am invested in stock market. Then I try to generate minimum 3% p.a. using covered calls making sure that my shares don't get called away.

Now I strongly believe in Murphy's law, i.e., whatever can go wrong will go wrong. So what is my maximum downside risk in this case?

In my opinion, I can face following two scenerios:

1. Price keeps climbing up and never drops below my PUT strike price. In that case I will be making only small premium gains and would be missing on the larger gains had I invested in VOO today. I am ~~happy~~ satisfied (Edit) with that as long as I am making above 3% p.a.
2. Price keeps dropping and I am holding VOO with unrealized losses. However if I can make minimum 3% p.a. using covered calls then I don't mind holding VOO for as long as possible. Anyway my intention is to invest in VOO.

What other things I am missing and not taking into account?

I wish the stock markets were not that high at the moment and I could just invest whatever I have in low cost index funds without thinking much."|investing|What can go wrong with this strategy?|0.0|0.41

First, housing pretty much only goes up looking at [20+ year time spans](
https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/).  I don't own a home (or any REITs), but housing is increasingly looking to me like the safest possible bet over the next decade.  I was going to wait out the storm to buy, but now I'm questioning that logic. It's also (IMO) by far the safest way to be leveraged, especially for a first time homebuyer.

People bring up '08, but I think it actually strengthens the case if anything. If you bought ""the average"" home at the absolute worst time at the very peak... you'd be up around 50% today. And  besides the appreciation in value you received the added benefit of living in the home, or collecting rental income if it's an investment property.

Then we have inflation. Whether transient or not, inflation is an absolute boon for debtholders. If you think the fed is wrong and inflation is going to be terrible, then buying the most expensive home you can reasonably afford seems like the best choice as inflation will eat away at the interest and maybe even some of the principal if it stays high enough long enough. Also the link above shows that over any 20+ year period, house prices have risen in actual value, adjusted for inflation.

The interest rates are still incredibly low and the Fed is going to slowly raise them, and a small amount. The current mortgage rates are basically unheard of in US history.  This is like a once in a generation opportunity with rates this low. 

Finally this seems like a straightforward supply and demand problem. The supply of desirable homes grows slowly, because (for example) in desirable locations like London/NYC/SF development is extremely slow or nonexistent due to housing and zoning laws. And the demand grows constantly, because the population size is increasing.

Am I looking at any of this wrong? How are home prices not going to spike even more hugely than before in the current environment? 

**tl;dr** low interest rates are good for housing, high inflation is good for people with debt, buying even at the peak of the housing bubble in 08 means you are up hugely today, and the population grows faster, than houses in desirable locations can be built. All seem to point to an increase in home prices"|investing|House prices, inflation, and interest rates|43.0|0.78

I’m a bit confused, however, on how often rebalancing should occur, and how my allocations of NEW money should occur.

For example - suppose I allocate 90% to VFIAX and 10% to VTIAX. Suppose that 10% of VTIAX drops to 8%. When I get my next paycheck, I’m order to re-adjust back to that 10%, I currently would put it all into VTIAX to stick with the desired allocation.

Additionally, every quarter I check to see if the balances strayed significantly (I do have an equation for this but it’s essentially +/- 2.5%-5% difference based on the desired allocation).

Is this the correct formula? Or should I still be buying at 90/10 proportions, and selling/buying later on (at the quarterly intervals)?

I ask because currently, my proportions are pretty drastically off due to some equities being pretty underwater at the moment, and I’m wondering if I should be:

* Continuing to buy those equities as they are “cheap” according to my average cost, as long as I still believe they have a future.
* Continue buying at the original proportion levels and just continue to follow how the market wants to go.

IBKR lets me buy and hold those stocks, but I have not dabbled in that area as investing in the US has historically been a good bet.

**Background**

The a2 Milk Company (A2M) was founded in New Zealand in 2000 on the knowledge that some people, having a certain level of lactose intolerance, who consume conventional cows’ milk, which contains a mixture between the A1 and A2 beta-casein protein, may experience digestive issues when drinking milk containing the A1 beta-casein protein. To solve this problem, A2M has supplied these consumers, with a premium milk product, only including the A2 beta-casein protein, since some of these consumers may experience health benefits, the Company reports.

The Company’s revenues primarily consist of its infant formula products (78% of total revenue in 1H21), while its liquid milk products are a smaller, but still significant part of the business (18% of total revenue in 1H21). The products are mainly being sold in New Zealand and Australia (ANZ) and China. Included in the ANZ market, is the daigou channel — which is comprised of Chinese merchants, primarily in Australia, who purchase the Company’s English-label products for consumers in China. These resellers have driven higher growth in the ANZ segment and the cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) segment of the business. Thus, the market in China is strategically important for the growth of the business. In China, the Company’s China-label infant formula products can be bought through mother and baby stores, modern supermarkets, and domestic e-commerce retail channels. English label products can be bought through ANZ retailers, ANZ-sourced resellers, and CBEC channels. 

A2M has been a phenomenal business seeing its revenues rise from NZ$0.352,5B in FY16 to NZ$1.732,5B in FY20, representing a CAGR of 48.9%. During the same period, the Company has seen a normalized net income CAGR of 88.9% and a free cash flow (FCF) CAGR of 113.4%, seeing most of the growth from consumers in China, as previously mentioned. Meanwhile, the Company had a return on equity between 30 to 50%, while being debt-free. Since the stock price peak in August 2020, the stock has tumbled from about NZ$22 a share to the bottom in May 2021 at about NZ$5.5 a share, which represents a decline of around 75%.

**What has caused the decline?**

Although the Company had this stellar performance, it has experienced some headwinds, which have been reflected in the stock price.

COVID-19 had a positive impact on the Company’s business at the start of the pandemic‚ when people were hoarding supplies at supermarkets, leading to further increased growth in the business in FY20. Since then, the Company has been adversely affected by the ongoing lockdowns in Australia, which has been extended and scheduled to end June 10th. Because of the lockdown, when international travel to and from Australia became restricted, the daigou resellers haven’t been able to buy products on behalf of Chinese consumers — which has been a problem for A2M, since the daigou channel constitutes a large portion of the Company’s revenues. Since the daigou channel is hard to track, the management has issued multiple revised outlooks for FY21, leading to share price decreases, because investors became concerned that the daigou channel wouldn’t return. Investors have become concerned, partly because the Chinese government has targeted the daigou channel, introducing stricter custom controls and regulating the gray market. Furthermore, the Australia-China relationship has put a damper to the prospect of future growth through the daigou channel since the relationship between the two countries began deteriorating in 2018 when a growing concern of political influence in various sectors of Australian society arose.

**Competitive advantage**

As previously mentioned, the Company sells its dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein, since some studies have shown, that people who experience digestive issues when consuming the A1 beta-casein protein might experience health benefits, when consuming dairy that only includes the A2 beta-casein protein. Although further studies have found a relation, which indicates health benefits for people with a certain level of dairy intolerance, a large body of evidence for the relation doesn’t exist, making the reported health benefits largely unknown. Nevertheless, the consumers *perceived* health benefits do provide a competitive advantage for A2M since the consumers don’t necessarily purchase products based on proven scientific evidence, as with e.g., organic products, but perhaps instead based on past experiences or recommendations, which is more evident with the products of A2M, given the high customer satisfaction, which can be observed at the reviews of the Company’s products.

A2M was the first business to offer dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein and has branded itself as a premium alternative to conventional milk products, claiming a price premium compared to normal milk.

In China, there’s a huge push to encourage the Chinese population to drink more milk, despite having 92.3% of Chinese adults suffering from a certain level of lactose intolerance and around 30% of Chinese children, since the consumption of milk in China is a means of combatting malnutrition, which has decreased due to governmental efforts and rising wealth in the country. Furthermore, the consumption of milk in China serves a political purpose, symbolizing a thriving society able to feed its population and having the population afford Western food. China has tried to meet its demand by increasing its domestic production through subsidies and regulation but hasn’t been able to produce enough, having demand consistently surpassing its domestic supply. China is, therefore, the largest importer of milk and will continue to depend on importing milk for the foreseeable future, because the cost of production in China is significantly higher, with a kilo of milk solids costing 43% more than its largest import partner New Zealand, the origin country of A2M. This provides a competitive advantage for dairy companies as A2M, driving growth for the foreseeable future.

In 2008, a Chinese milk scandal emerged, involving Chinese milk producers adding melamine to infant formula products to increase the protein content to pass quality control testing. This resulted in a total of 300,000 victims and several deaths, leading to a loss of consumer confidence in Chinese milk producers in China, continuing until today, where over 50% of Chinese consumers preferring foreign brands for baby formula. 

The infant formula market in China is driven by two opposing trends; China’s slowing birth rate and its growing income, making the population increasingly able to purchase more expensive products. China has grown fourfold since 2012 and makes up around 25% of the world’s demand for dairy, and it’s estimated to overtake the United States as the world's largest dairy market by 2022.

The growth prospect of the Chinese segment of the business, including the fact that most of the Chinese population suffer from a certain level of lactose intolerance and have low consumer confidence for its domestic producers, provides a competitive advantage for A2M, making it able to reap the benefits of the growing Chinese milk market. 

**Management**

The newly instated CEO of A2M is David Bortolussi, assuming the role at the start of 2021. Bortolussi has experience with growing brands and turning around companies in trouble, making him the perfect fit to become the CEO of A2M. The management has driven the Company forward, achieving high rates of growth in the business. They seem honest and trustworthy when answering questions on their conference calls, making the listeners understand the Company better. The management is currently expecting the daigou channel to resume when the uncertainty of the pandemic is over.

It’s possible to argue, that the severity of the decline in the stock price partly was due to the management’s poor communication to shareholders, sending a total of four revised outlooks for FY21, leading to a decreased trustworthiness among investors. Contrary, to the defense of the management, the daigou channel is hard to anticipate, being a gray market. Nevertheless, the management was able to sell a large portion of their stock right before the downturn, while still outwardly expecting further increased growth for FY21, reflecting on the ethics and honesty of the management. 

**Valuation**

Since we’re interested in holding the business over the long haul, including the fact that it’s hard to predict the Company’s short-term FCF, given the uncertainty surrounding the lockdowns in Australia, which has put a damper on the daigou channel, the post-pandemic value of the Company will first be calculated, using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method over the next 10 years with conservative assumptions, to minimize the likelihood of overestimating the value.

As previously mentioned, the pandemic first had a positive impact on the business, when people were hoarding supplies at supermarkets, making the Company a total of NZ$0.420,2B in FCF in FY20 up from NZ$0.285,7B in FY19, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Since a part of the FCF in FY20 is artificially up due to the positive impact at the start of the pandemic, a more conservative estimate for the starting year of FCF is the average FCF in FY19 and FY20, being around NZ$0.350,0B, making the FCF yield to the current market cap of NZ$4.832,2B around 7.2%.

Since the analysts expect a growth rate of around 24% for the next 5 years, a growth rate of 20% for the first 5 years of the model will be used, due to conservatism. Furthermore, the growth rate of 15% for the last 5 years of the model is chosen, since the growth in the business will likely taper off when the Company becomes larger. As an estimate of the terminal value of A2M, a multiple of FCF of 15 is chosen, due to the high quality and growth rate of the business. The Company’s latest report for 1H21 shows that A2M has NZ$0.774,6B in cash at hand and NZ$0.017,5 in debt, making the post-pandemic present value for the entire Company — using a discount rate of 10% — NZ$16.272,3, representing a discount of the current market cap to the intrinsic value of 70.3%. The intrinsic value per share is therefore NZ$21.91, making it on par with the stock price before the crash. 

Instead of calculating the intrinsic value of the business, a DCF method can be utilized, to calculate the growth rate in which the market expects from the Company, given the current market cap. Assuming the same starting year of FCF of NZ$0.350,0B, multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, a discount rate of 10%, and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around -0.5% for the next 10 years is priced into the Company. If it, therefore, is assessed, that A2M can grow faster than -0.5% a year for 10 years, the Company is trading at a bargain price. 

The calculated intrinsic value of NZ$16.272,3, assumes the daigou channel to recover when the pandemic is over. As a thought experiment, it’s possible to solely value the China-label part of the business, which has been largely unaffected during the pandemic since the products are imported directly from New Zealand and increasing by 101.2% in FY20 on the prior corresponding period. Since the China-label component as of 2H20 represents 25% of the total revenues (currently 40%, having the ANZ segment decreased) and continually improving, the FCF for the China-label business can be estimated to NZ$0.087,5 (25%\*NZ$0.350,0). Assuming the same multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, discount rate of 10% and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around 18.5% per annum is needed for the next 10 years, to make the intrinsic value of the business equal to the present market cap. If it’s possible to achieve this growth in China, which it currently succeeds immensely, the ANZ, rising North American segment, and other Asian components of the business, are given for free. 

The opportunity of investing in A2M presents an asymmetrical risk to reward, which makes the investment more appealing. Given that the growth stabilizes to pre-pandemic levels, once the uncertainty of the pandemic relating to the business is over, the risk of opportunity cost arises since the intrinsic value is calculated on a post-pandemic basis, perhaps making it possible to put capital more effectively into use in the meantime. Over the long-term, it could be possible for the Company to diversify its product line into other dairy products, making the calculated present value of the business an even greater bargain. Since the management hasn’t bought stock in the Company, despite expecting growth in daigou channel to resume, while knowing the prospects of the business, increases the risk of investing in the business.

(source:[https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-completes-500m-offering-of-senior-secured-notes-due-2028-with-bitcoin-use-of-proceeds\_06-14-2021](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-completes-500m-offering-of-senior-secured-notes-due-2028-with-bitcoin-use-of-proceeds_06-14-2021))

but here's the thing, Microstrategy is simply where loans are accumulated and bitcoins are purchased, they transfer their assets to Macrostrategy. Macrostrategy holds 90k bitcoins.(source:[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-macrostrategy-bitcoin-arm](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-macrostrategy-bitcoin-arm))

My questions are:  
**Is this sort of like PE leveraged buyouts?**  
In that, they buy and take more loans out to buy more but then they wind down the company declare bankruptcy and then liquidate its assets.

**Or is Microstrategy simply an investment vehicle that also sells/develops software but also issues (traunched?) securities from its pool of debt?**  
In that, they take loans out backed by bitcoins to issue more securities from a pool of debt and eat the spread on the interest.

**Or is something else at play?**

**How should an investor approach this corporate structure when considering Microstrategy as a potential investment?**

**TLDR**; no financial advice; FCF-wise it seems shareholders might even get less than before. I would appreciate your feedback. Growth considerations of the new company not included here.

The following is based on this [investor presentation](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_presentations/2021/ATT-Discovery-WM-05172021-FINAL.pdf) of May 17 and morningstar data.

Page 5 and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Morris_Trust) tell me the nature of the merger is that AT&amp;T shareholders will receive shares representing 71% of the new merged company in addition to their existing AT&amp;T shares (which then represent AT&amp;T minus WarnerMedia). Discovery shares will simply (I guess) switch from representing 100% of the former Discovery to 29% of the new company.

I am AT&amp;T holder and was wondering what the presentation tells me... I created the following table to consider how much of FCF my shares will be eligible to - irrespective of dividend payouts... and not doing a DCF or growth perspective. Basically this consideration is about on the day of the ""merger"", will I get more or less FCF per share? Data is copied from morningstar, Dec 2019 and Dec 2020. 

**Status Quo** is a scenario without merger... what FCF would shares get?

**No Synergies** means the EBIDTA synergies of merging in the new company are not realized as on pdf page 11.

**Synergies** means the EBIDTA synergies of merging in the new company are realized as on pdf page 11.

As pdf page 15 says AT&amp;T expects at least 20B+ USD in FCF after merger, I consider 20B and 22 B (some arbitrary 10% fluctuation on my side) to vary scnearios a bit. FCF conversion for the new company (60%) is taken from page 11.

**Discovery\*** represents the Discovery company values in case of no merger or the merged company.

The upper part is for AT&amp;T shareholders, the lower part is the Discovery shareholders' perspective.

Entries are billions of USD.

**Summary**:

* It's hard to beat 2019 numbers FCF wise.
* Shareholders gain FCF if synergies are realized 
* Shareholders gain if AT&amp;T achieves more than 20 billion USD
* Growth is not included in this consideration, potentially a DCF taking into account growth could reveal more upside for shareholders.

Cyclical stocks on Thursday, the day after the announcement, suffered their worst day in over a year when compared to defensive stocks as investors feared the central bank’s tapering could derail the economy. Cyclicals include sectors like industrials, energy and financials, whose performance is tied to the whims of the economy. 



A ""cyclical correction is now underway,"" wrote a team led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. 


He noted this week’s hawkish shift by the Fed is ""bad news"" and adds to the troubles that were presented by excess positioning, China tightening and fading hopes of additional fiscal stimulus in the U.S. 

The Fed on Wednesday held its benchmark interest rate near zero and maintained its bond-buying program at a pace of $120 billion per month, but moved up the forecast for its first rate hike to 2023 from 2024. More members, but not a majority, said the first rate hike could occur in 2022. The central bank also teased an end to its asset purchase program, but did not give any specifics as to when the tapering might begin. 

The Fed last year cut interest rates to near zero and pledged to buy an unlimited amount of assets to support the U.S. economy through its sharpest economic slowdown of the post-World War II era. 

The yield on the 10-year bond note fell to 1.45% on Friday in response to the Fed’s tightening plans. It hit a high of 1.75% on March 31. 

David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Toronto-based Rosenberg Research says that **adjusted for interest rates, the S&amp;P 500 is 20% above its intrinsic value.**

He believes investors would be foolish to ignore the signal that real rates, or those adjusted for inflation, are sending to the stock market.



""Overweighting defensive sectors and secular growth segments that tend to benefit by a sharp slowing in GDP growth, is a sound strategy,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, if the message from real rates proves prescient, investors will be well advised to trim their cyclical exposures."""|investing|A Stock market's most popular trade faces 'perfect storm' A 'cyclical correction is now underway|0.0|0.26

Here we are.  One week left to get this done.

The good news is that C-218 was picked up in Thursday's session, and the most threatening amendment proposal, related to game fixing, was voted down with a majority.  The bill is now in mid-completion in the Senate, which means that one, they will likely get to it and two, they will not need as much time to go through it when it hits the floor again.  Also good news is that they have added an additional day tomorrow (Monday) to debate, and there seems to be a light agenda.  This sets the stage for final approval of C-218 by the end of the week.

The not-so-good news is that there is an amendment still in front of us at this point.  The Kahanawake are NOT happy that they will be losing their monopoly in Canada, and have been putting up a fight through the process.

The amendment was tabled in last week's session, but it was not debated.  Most coverage of this and social feedback has been negative, acknowledging the request but positioning it as an attempt to delay, block, or kill the bill through the cover of ""making it fair"".  No comment on the legitimacy of this claim, but the amendment request is likely to fail.  

As for the bill?  The first amendment was voted down with a majority, so it does signal overall support, but I can't say for sure that it's a done deal.  However, as a signal, the House of Commons voted for the bill with around a 90% majority.

As for price action, there was definitely a run-up on Thursday in anticipation of the success of the measure, then a sell-off on Friday when it didn't pass.  The run-up may occur again, albeit with more instability due to the final hour nature of the bill.  Overall, it is expected that the price of SCR and related stocks will rise as the market opens up over time, hopefully by the Fall.  A good time to participate, nonetheless.

1) The risk to growth worldwide is significant and after a brief reopening burst we are headed back into deflationary pressures.

I want to buy a stock, for instance XOM. I buy 500 shares. It goes up 1% and I sell 495 shares.

The next time this opportunity happens I rinse and repeat. Accumulating another 5 shares.

The problem I'm having is that historically I've been told I need to shoot for long term capital gains for the favorable taxes.

But obviously if I buy a dip and sell out the gain...easier said than done...then the stocks I sell will never be long term.

But, also, they will always be the higher gained stock (older) than the lower gained stock. Inflating the capital gains.

I realize there is a way to sell the last in first, should I do this? 

Default is first in first out...so is there a way to change that default? Because I can't be flexible if I wait for declarations through the broker.

So am I just stuck on the taxes and should forget about the idea of long term capital gains?

The alternative is to just accumulate cash in a trading account and use any gains (if any) to transfer to a holding account that holds stocks very long term.

But then I'm overwhelmed by the fact that I don't want to be forced to hold a stock because of unfavorable taxes because it's been gaining for 20 years. Like ATT.

ATT basically sucks now. But I've had it for so long that selling it makes me look like a huge winner...

A problem I'd never be in if I never followed this long term holding strategy from when younger.

I don’t see this talked much about. If an international investor is buying US equities in dollars, they are paying in their own currency which is converted to dollars. 
Since the US dollar is the global reserve currency, we obviously had a lot of printing in 2020. 25% of all US dollar in existence was printed last year. Expectedly, this leads to inflation. Whether is temporary or not remains to be seen but it would not be surprising to see a less valuable dollar. 

Wouldn’t this also mean a smaller ROI for US stocks? For example, you may make a 10% gain on Apple and gain $13 per share. However, if the pound (£) is now 10% stronger against USD, when your USD is converted back to £, you may not even end up making a profit. 
It seems this is likely to happen with the inflation numbers coming out. E.g UK YoY inflation was 2.1%, US was 5%.

How do you account for this, if at all, when investing for the long term? I guess you could stick to investing in companies in your own country but the growth is likely not there compared to the US.

I understand the appeal of having ""passive income"" but to me it seems like stealing money from your future self. Unless I have a gross concept error on what living off dividends really entails, I can't help but think people are too enamored with ""free money"" to consider the gains they are giving up as a consequence.

Edit: My question stemmed from a concern that dividends were being portrayed as a form of passive income before retirement, I understand that once you are no longer working you have to have a way to continue to support yourself and your family. Nowadays there is so much hype about trying to find more ways to make money outside of your a job, and personally I think that while you're still working dividends should be considered passive investing (kind of like 401k matching) rather than passive ""income"". 

So a better and slightly different question is, why do so many people like the idea of having 100% of living expenses covered by dividends? It almost seems like it contradicts the idea of having a diversified portfolio.

Been thinking about this strategy for about a year now and have tested it out with minor success, wanted feedback and the potential whys of how this could go wrong before I go heavily into it. This is also gonna be alot so I’ll put a TLDR below.

Main point of this strategy, a robinhood covered call wheel, is it is very low risk (focusing on mostly blue chips), with potentially very high returns, especially if you are willing to never sell at a loss. The only catch is that this strategy will work best in a slightly bullish market, not too bullish and not too bearish, or alternatively with only stocks that have a slightly bullish trend. 

If you are not too familiar with how options and covered calls work you may have a hard time following and I apologize in advance but I will try my best.

I will discuss the mathematics part momentarily and why the returns can be potentially very high (as high as 20-40% annually). 

*** Skim this next part if you are already familiar with selling covered calls ***

The basic premise is selling short term covered calls, for anyone who was in the same boat as I was and not too familiar with options, is I would buy 100 shares of a company I believe will have a slightly bullish trend for at least the next few weeks or months, and then the same day I buy those 100 shares, sell an option for someone to buy those shares at let’s say 5% above what I paid for it, they receive the option to buy my shares if it hits that strike price at lets say 2 weeks from now, I immediately receive the premium. 

Not ideal case #1: So I just sold the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the only way I can lose money now is if the stock price drops in the next 2 weeks more then amount of money I made from getting the premium. Even so, I keep the 100 shares, and when that option expires I sell another covered call, always above what I paid for. In that case, I keep raking in premiums (though they will diminish if the stock continues to fall in price) and I keep the shares. I will never sell at a loss, and I just repeat the process.

Not ideal case #2: I sell the covered call 2 weeks from now, the stock soars above the call’s strike price I set. I have to sell those 100 shares, but I’m still selling above what I paid for, and I still keep the premium. I lost out on potential gains by having to sell, but I secured gains and I can move onto a different stock now, or wait for that stock to drop to a price im comfortable buying back in at and repeat.

Ideal case: I sell the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the stock stays the same price throughout those 2 weeks or jumps sightly up in value, but doesn’t hit the strike price. Perfect, I now keep the premium, keep the 100 shares, and after researching the stock and making my prediction for what it will be at, sell another covered call 2 weeks from now. I repeat this for as long as possible until one of the two cases above happens.

So there is the main premise for my strategy. The variables are the following:
- Finding the ideal slightly-bullish stock
- Finding the right strike price to sell the covered call
- Finding stocks that aren’t too volatile but have high valued option prices
- Acquiring the capital needed to make the biggest returns (I will explain this below)

Before I am judged for using Robinhood, consider the Robinhood Gold margin rate. 2.5% annually. That is the most competitive margin rate on the market, compared to Fidelity’s 7%, Schwabs starting 8%, and most other financial institutions around the same rate. 

This is why I pick Robinhood, despite it’s controversies. I can effectively double my money for only 2.5% interest, and because this is such a low risk strategy because it is primarily using bluechips, there is very little risk of losing money and owning a debt to Robinhood. 

Now, time for the good part, the math, and why I like this strategy so much. 

For this example I will use the bluechip IT company Intel (INTC). 

*** EXAMPLE ***
INTC is as of now currently trading at 55.67 a share, for simplicity I will round it up to 56. After doing my research, I feel like this stock fits my strategy well, so I want to buy 100 shares of it to start the wheel process. It will cost $5,600, but by using margin I only put in $2,800. I now analyze their options that expire a week from now. I pick the $58 strike price option which is going for about $.30 a share. I sell the option, collect the premium (100 x $.30 = $30.) And now I wait. 1 week later, Intel price remained about the same. I keep the $30 and I sell another call for next week, and rinse and repeat. I just made $120 safely in a month, from an initial investment of $2800. That is a 4% return in a month. Do that for a year and you can see why earlier I made those return predictions of 20-40%. 

Anyways, that pretty much wraps up my strategy. The past few months I have made a safe few hundred already on blue chips just from an initial investment of about $5000. 

I would love to hear any other investors thoughts, expertise, criticisms, or feedback on this.

The Federal Open Market Committee’s latest policy communications raised more questions than answers. Perhaps the biggest one: Can the Fed ever really raise interest rates?

&amp;#x200B;

At face value, and with a big dose of relativity, this past week’s updated summary of economic projections and commentary from Chairman Jerome Powell marks a hawkish turn. Officials signaled rates could rise in 2023, earlier than previously telegraphed. And during his press conference, Powell acknowledged for the first time that inflation may turn out to be hotter and more persistent than the Fed has projected—no small change for a person who has pushed the idea of transitory inflation, says Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you take a step back, the Fed remains about as dovish as ever. When the consumer-price index is running at 5%, it’s hardly hawkish to say there is a chance price acceleration is faster and lasts longer than anticipated. It already is, and it already has.

&amp;#x200B;

 Powell, like past Fed chiefs, told investors to take the so-called dot plot of officials’ economic projections with a big grain of salt. But to the extent the dots are useful for reading the internal debate, they still show that only three members changed their view for raising rates in 2022, not enough to lift the median forecast from 0.125%. How hawkish can this all really be if, all told, the most skeptical members are thinking about raising rates by 0.5% in 2023? Moreover, the dots’ 2023 message runs counter to the Fed’s own updated economic forecasts. It still sees inflation hardly above 2% in 2022 and 2023, despite the new tolerance for above-target inflation, and it predicts a meaningful slowdown in growth after this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stocks and bonds initially sold off on Wednesday after the Fed’s policy meeting but quickly recovered. The Nasdaq Composite index, full of expensive growth stocks, closed just off a record high on Thursday and bore the lightest brunt of Friday’s selloff after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he expects the first increase in late 2022 (Bullard is a voting member next year). Still, Friday’s declines are hardly a tantrum and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was lower Friday than where it was before the Fed news. More interesting still is how the 5-year/5-year overnight indexed swap has traded.

&amp;#x200B;

The 5-year/5-year OIS captures investors’ expectations for the peak fed-funds rate in the business cycle, says Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. When long rates were selling off earlier this year, the gauge rose to about 2.40%, he says, suggesting traders assumed that the next tightening cycle would look broadly like the last one. After the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, the gauge was yielding 1.94%. At press time on Friday, it was at 1.71%—the lowest yield since early February.

&amp;#x200B;

“We don’t believe you,” the futures market is effectively telling the Fed, “and saying it loud and clear with a megaphone,” LaVorgna says.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent history has sided with the market, not policy makers, he says. He points to the long-run equilibrium funds rate, which the Fed had to keep revising lower amid a falling 5-year/5-year OIS. Once thought to be around 4%, the Fed’s long-run rate estimate is now between 2% and 3%. The high end of that range still appears far too high if the 5-year/5-year OIS is a guide.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes sense. Financial markets’ sensitivity to monetary policy has never been higher. The Fed’s balance sheet has doubled since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, now 40% of gross domestic product. By buying massive amounts of bonds, the Fed has lowered rates and used asset prices—especially stocks—as a primary tool for monetary policy. That’s through the wealth effect, or the tendency for consumers (which make up two-thirds of gross domestic product) to spend more as their assets grow. Any correction in stock prices would negatively affect economic growth and thus limit the Fed’s ability to tighten, the logic goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Less discussed: the prospect of further fiscal spending would itself make tapering bond purchases a tall order. The Fed has become such a dominant force in the bond market and would presumably need to keep buying the additional debt as the Treasury incurs it. (The Biden administration has proposed a $6 trillion budget for 2022).

&amp;#x200B;

That’s one piece of the argument that the Fed won’t be able to meaningfully tighten. Another is the debt side of the economy. If the Fed was unable to lift rates above 2.5% during the last tightening cycle, and had to cut rates in several meetings before the pandemic prompted its emergency actions early last year, why would it be able to raise now? Since then, U.S. households, businesses, and the federal government have grown only more indebted.

&amp;#x200B;

“When an economy is running a debt-to-GDP ratio at 100% or more and growth is debt-driven, it’s very hard to raise rates,” LaVorgna says. “The Fed is in a box and I don’t think it can get out of it.”

&amp;#x200B;

The upshot? Easy money is likely to be flowing well beyond 2023. For now, that would translate into continuing stock-market gains, especially in rate-sensitive areas like technology. What that means for the U.S. economy is another question, and what it means for markets longer term is yet another.

&amp;#x200B;

To LaVorgna, it probably all leads to what he calls secular stagnation. A euphemism, perhaps, for stagflation.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors worried about inflation remain no less concerned. The Fed tiptoed toward acknowledging that current policy doesn’t square with reality, but it didn’t really move the needle, says Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “I’m someone who thinks the Fed has been doing 200 miles per hour in a 50 mph speed zone. I saw Powell slow down to 175.”

&amp;#x200B;

Boockvar remains long areas that hold up best during periods of rising inflation, including energy and agriculture stocks, precious metals, and Asian and European equities. “Inflation is now a Main Street story,” he says. “I’m gritting my teeth and sticking to it.”

1624139036.0|0.0|t3_o3qla8|4.0|"Let me preface this by saying that I am pretty convinced by the ""buy index funds and hold"" strategy of investing. Although I wouldn't go so far as to argue that no one is capable of picking stocks that beat the average market risk-return profile, I think this capability is probably extremely rare, at best, especially over the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my friend recently proposed an investing strategy somewhere in between this and short-term stock picking, that I am now considering. I thought I would lay it out here for constructive criticism:

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to pick some technologies that we expect to be a big part of the future, invest in some companies (or index funds) that are in this area, and hold them as long as possible (on the scale of decades). For example, I think that brain-computer interfaces will eventually be very pervasive and transformative, so under this strategy, I would take some money out of my various index funds, and invest it in Neuralink and similar companies.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, I do think that, as an engineer, I have a slightly better than average prediction of technologies that will be important in the future. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much better this prediction would be than the weighted average of all other investors. Additionally, although I think it's easy to say ""x technology will eventually be very important"", I think it's much harder to say exactly when. Just like pointed out in the book ""Soonish"", technological advancement is heavily interdependent and often occurs when an unexpected breakthrough suddenly opens up a whole range  of possibilities. Thus, timing and specifics are harder to predict than general trends. The idea is to try to mitigate the timing factor by investing until retirement, but I'm unsure if this will be long enough to average out the noise. (Both my friend and I are currently 26)

&amp;#x200B;

Further, I wonder if picking individual stocks, even if at random, returns higher than index funds. It certainly has much higher risk, which is usually associated with higher average return, but maybe in this case, the risk comes without any gain because it is purely a result of failing to sufficiently diversify?

A lot hinges on what the Feds say tomorrow and I am betting they will ""quiet the markets"".

They needed to temper bulls but I don't think their intention is a sell off.

My thoughts on their statement is irrelevant. We can look at VXX as a further indicator.

Banks are a long indicator while VXX is a short indicator and right now both have been moving to opposite of each other. 

Banks moved into bearish territory and now stocks at large are doing the same. But VXX is moving I to bullish territory. 

However.

Volume-trend analysis has a few maxims.

Primarily, if price moves away from the trend line on large volume it CONFIRMS the trend line.

If price moves back to the trend line on low volume it CONFIRMS the trend line.

When volume decreases and price moves away from the trend line it is sign that a trend is about to reverse.

This general rule of thumb shows that we are too early in a potential sell-off to know what to do exactly.

VXX is only one day into moving away from its trend line and it has done so at massive increase of volume.

If price follows a trend line on lower volume, it confirms a trend.

So more data will pour in Monday but the big things we are looking for is:

Do Banks move away from their trend line on lower volume than past few days? 

Does VXX move away from trend line on even higher volume or does it move back to trend line on lower volume. Either of which helps to confirm the trend. 

In which case the sell off is a brief sell off and ride it out.

But if the bank trend is confirmed. And the VXX trend shows signs of breaking. Then the sell off is likely to worsen.

My understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. and that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China’s growing global technological dominance. Those companies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace after receiving these funds, regardless of other fundamental or technical factors.

However, the funds will come in the form of grants and tax credits. My understanding, and here's where I'm making big assumptions, is that companies must apply to receive the funds and that this is an involved and competitive process. The law won’t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then, companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.

INTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they’re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they’re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn’t mean they couldn’t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?

AMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&amp;D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.

It won’t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds. There probably won’t be any winners for projects until at least a year from now.

Catalysts:

* Bill gets signed by the end of this year.
* Companies submit applications for projects and winners are announced.
* Winners start receiving funds and investing them in projects.

**First, what are standard assets to buy during high-inflation periods?**

You have a couple of broad categories here. The simplest category is “stores of value,” items that tend to retain value in the long run. These include:  
\-Precious metals (gold, platinum, etc.)  
\-Commodities (metals are a subset of this, but this also includes oil, corn, etc.)  
\-Real estate  
\-Blue chip stocks

The next broad category is the collection of assets that “float” with inflation; these things tend to track whatever inflation is doing. These include:  
\-Utility stocks (people still need water, electricity, etc.)  
\-Some dividend stocks (overlaps with blue chip stocks)  
\-TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities; gov’t bonds designed for inflation)

The last category is an asset that does well during inflation:  
\-Leveraged companies (companies with a lot of debt borrowed at a fixed rate; the inflation makes the loans easier to pay back)

Bonus category:  
\-Cryptocurrencies (no one knows how these assets “traditionally” do because they haven’t been around long enough to have a “tradition”)

**Second how are these inflation-related assets doing now?**

I have bad news for you: Markets are forward-looking. The inflation hedges were being bought months ago. For myself, I did my largest personal inflation hedge last October: I refinanced my home mortgage to 2.85% and took out some equity. Before that I moved assets into a leveraged companies mutual fund, a commodity ETF, etc. Because other investors also did these things months ago, asset prices are high now.

Some of these asset prices have also been dramatically affected by non-inflation factors. Inflation is one scenario trade everyone has been dealing with, but pandemic (covid) is another scenario trade, US political instability is another scenario trade, the rise of cryptocurrencies is another scenario trade, etc. As a result, there is a lot of noise in the market prices, and it can be hard to untangle the effects of, for instances, the pandemic scenario vs the inflation scenario (though one basically caused the other).

Something like gold is more complicated than an inflation-only indicator. Track the price of gold and Bitcoin over the past two years. During the worst of the pandemic market downturn, gold held pretty well with bad news; Bitcoin tanked. That tells you something. (Both eventually rose) But there are other interesting factors. Gold is \*not\* rising recently as inflation fears have ramped up. Why? Well, looking at price history, gold was already being bought as a crisis hedge for pandemic. It was also likely being bought as a US political instability hedge. So the noise and signal in the price is hard to tease out for merely the inflation signal. Gold prices, and all asset prices lately, have been carrying multiple signals within their prices. The political stability signal may be noise to the inflation signal; all scenario signals will affect price. Each scenario has its own price pressures.

Are asset prices high right now? Yes. We could be at the edge of a price cliff. Inflation could be tamed and prices could stabilize or drop. But we could also be at a cliff at the BASE of the cliff. Prices are high now, but if we enter into cycles of hyper-inflation, then today’s prices may seem like a bargain in tomorrow’s inflated dollars. There are people who predict both the end of inflation and much greater inflation to come. You’ll have to decide for yourself which path seems more likely and/or problematic for your personal situation.

**So if asset prices are already high for inflation hedges, what should you do?**

First off, in this case and in every case be forward-thinking! If you’re just starting to think about inflation now, you’re chasing the markets. Markets have already been adjusting for inflation for a long time. That doesn’t mean inflation won’t get worse; it very well could. What it does mean is that prices are already up. We have seen big moves in real estate, such as the refinance industry like I did with my personal refi, and as many REITs and other firms have done with massive property buys. But just because we’re at a high doesn’t mean we’re at a top. Prices could be at a top, prices could be at a relative low compared to coming inflation. Don’t just think, “Inflation! Buy real estate!” or “Prices are high! Don’t buy real estate!” Instead, think about where things are going over the next few months. Are markets properly efficient now or do will they be adjusting further in the coming months? Look forward.

Second, do your homework! If you’re an active investor (which presumably you are if you are in this forum), then it is incumbent upon you to do your research. Do due diligence. Think about possible future paths and have a plan for the major paths.

Third, if we’re in a period of high inflation, hopefully at some point we will return to a period of low inflation. Make your plan for that scenario NOW. You may not enact the plan now because we may experience more inflation before this cycle ends. But rather than being surprised by the end of inflation, have your trades ready to execute when you think the inflationary period is about to end.  
\-Identify triggers (indicators that the inflationary period’s end is coming)  
\-Identify major paths (how events are likely to unfold)  
\-Identify targets for investment (assets that will do best in a return to low inflation)

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I think about things; your mileage may vary. But in all cases do your homework and look a step or two ahead rather than just reacting to the day’s news. If you act after the market is efficient, you lose on the trades. Be ready before the broader market moves.

1624102444.0|0.0|t3_o3e0n5|1.0|"I was looking for Chinese stocks that would pay decent dividends (at least 2-3%), however, I cannot find any?
I am wondering if the VIE structure has anything to do with that. If we buy BABA, NIO, TCEHY or whatever else, we don’t get any actual ownership. 

AFAIK VIE works like the following. Chinese laws forbid foreigners from owning Chinese stocks. So the Chinese stock you buy actually only grants you a stake in some Cayman Islands-registered entity. These entities are under contracts to receive some profits from the Chinese assets but not to actually own them. This is how BABA, NIO, XPEV or whatever else Chinese works like. Besides, VIE technically is illegal but China has been silent on that.(more on the VIE structure https://globescancapital.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/)

Aside from all the political risks, I am wondering - if a Chinese company no longer needs to raise capital in the West, why would it keep the obligation to share profits with the shareholders? If the VIE structure is not enforceable, the shareholders of the Cayman Island companies (again: BABA, XPEV, NIO) could end up with empty bags while the profits would go to CEO/board/Chinese shareholders.

Also given that shareholders are not entitled to any ACTUAL entity in the Chinese company, the board/CEO can decide to simply transfer ownership of the company’s assets to somewhere else thus leaving shareholders emptyhanded and thus NIO, BABA and whatever else could easily go to 0 while the actual companies may thrive.

And this can harm not only retail. There was this dispute between Yahoo and Alibaba when Jack Ma transfered ownership of Alipay from the group to an entity controlled by himself and didn’t even inform other shareholders.(https://www.ft.com/content/40a66dd2-b9ec-11e0-8171-00144feabdc0)

So if the Chinese companies trading under VIE structure don’t pay out their profits (technically the sole reason for the VIE structure), it looks like they should be bought only for speculation purposes.

These are companies that are massive all over the world and used daily by millions of people. Coke and McDonald's are possibly the two most recognised companies on the face of the Earth. They aren't companies that I would expect to grow *massively* over time, but I can see them still steadily growing as they slowly aim to corner any remaining markets they haven't yet tackled.

**What Does La-Z-Boy Do?**

La-Z-Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States. They are based in Monroe, Michigan, and they make home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs, and sleeper sofas.

La-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey, and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms. They employ approximately 9400 workers at this time.

La-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group, and the Retail Group.

The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, and sleeper sofas.

The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces, and some coordinated upholstered furniture.

The Retail Group consists of 70 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network.

In July 2018 La-Z-Boy also acquired online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.

**The bull case**

* **Reason #1 - Oversold - It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article 2 days ago saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it approximately 33% below fair value. What is the reason for the selloff? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the selloff is an overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day Chairman Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
* **Reason #2 - The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has a relatively low market cap any negative news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.
* **Reason #3 - Never before seen boom in home furnishings -** Warren Shoulberg, a senior editor at Forbes, noted that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales. r/investing does not allow linking to Forbes due to blog-style articles being published there so I will simply point out some salient points from the story -

&gt;If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

&gt;For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Reason #4** \- **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report** \- [**https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/**](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/)
* **Reason #5** \-**Despite LZB being an iconic furniture brand it is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to the recent selloff -** [**https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm**](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm)
* **Reason #6 - Dividend-paying stock -** LZB suspended their dividend last year due to the pandemic but it has been reinstated as of this quarter. Part of the recent selloff was possibly also because the dividend was just paid this month. If they follow the same trend as they always have in years prior to COVID they should be expected to announce their next dividend in late August with dividend payment in early-mid September. Here is their dividend history-

[https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend\_history.php?q=lzb](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=lzb)

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Continued global supply chain issues. Raw material prices skyrocket even higher -** The primary reason for the selloff appears to be management's warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases. LZB's problems could be exacerbated if inflation continues to run hot and raw material prices skyrocket even higher.
* **Reason #2 - Suspension of dividends again -** LZB management suspended their dividend for 4 quarters due to Covid and only recently reinstated it last quarter. A major supply chain disruption or other internal issues could cause them to suspend it again.

**What are the transient factors that have affected the price of the stock?**

I am adding this section to clarify this point. I will quote directly from the earnings call which can be read in its entirety here-

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/)

This is what caused the selloff-

&gt;Regarding production capacity, demand trends remained strong across the business with backlog at record levels, providing for a long tail. We anticipate ongoing incremental increases in capacity through fiscal 2022 as new assembly cells are added and efficiencies improve, which will result in continued incremental progress on delivered sales. However, we expect temporary significant pressures on profit margins in the first half of fiscal '22 compared to the very strong profit margin of this Q4. We expect to face ongoing global supply chain disruptions and escalating raw material and freight costs, which will cause volatility in results and will eventually be offset by our already announced pricing actions in the back half of the year as we work through our backlog.

Analysts clarified this point further during the call:

&gt;**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
&gt;  
&gt;So Bob, I just want to circle right back quickly to your comments about the 300 bps of margin pressure just to make sure we're all on the same page of what's that referencing in kind of what timeframe. So is that in reference to the 10% EBIT margin that was posted in 4Q? And are you saying that 1Q and 2Q of 2021 should be down about 300 bps at the highest level possible versus first at 10% if raw material headwinds were as strong as they could be?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
&gt;  
&gt;That's correct.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
&gt;  
&gt;Okay. And then -- so for both quarters kind of the same type of trajectory off the 10%. I mean, that would put 2Q though below where kind of it was in the October of '19 quarter which was 7.5%. Is that all just raw material related or mix of business or could we end up at 7% EBIT margins below than kind of where we were two years ago even?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
&gt;  
&gt;It's mostly the raw material impacts that we're seeing. And again, we've taken pricing and it's taking a while for that pricing to work its way through. So it will work its way through by toward the end of Q2 into Q3 and that's when our margins will start improving.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
&gt;  
&gt;Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then trying to -- usually 1Q is the seasonally weak quarter, but with this large of a backlog that you have, I think in the 10-K it was $617 million or something called out. I mean, is the right way to think about the potential revenue side of things here in 1Q basically 12, 13 of what you delivered in 4Q or is there something wrong with kind of using that as an estimate?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think there's anything wrong using that as an estimate.

As such, their margins may be lower this quarter if raw material prices continue to be as high as they've been but they've already taken actions that will cause this pressure to lift by the end of Q2 going into Q3 and while margins may be lower the actual revenue and profits will again beat records thanks to the immense backlog in orders that they're now fulfilling thanks to the additional capacity they have added.

**Financials &amp; Valuation**

LZB balance sheet can be viewed at [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB) for reference to what I state below.

* LZB is a profitable business with a consistent adjusted EBITDA margin of around 10% which is in line with industry standards -[https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry\_Profitability\_Ratios.php?ind=407](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?ind=407)
* Debt-free - LZB is debt-free.
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed short-term liabilities ($611.7M).
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed long-term liabilities ($392.5M).
* Regarding valuation, I have already covered this in the bull case where LZB is now nearly 33% undervalued as per the [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) calculation. The Nasdaq story only says 21% because it was published when the stock price was still $42 and it is now trading around $36.

Based on all this I believe LZB is a great business and iconic brand that is currently trading well below fair value. I believe this represents a great investment opportunity.

**TL;DR:** LZB stock faced a selloff this week because management warned that record high raw material prices would affect their bottom line in the short term. Management also noted that these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. Considering this, I believe the stock is oversold as it is considered as much as 33% undervalued as per [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) at current prices which represents a great investment opportunity."|investing|LZB (La-Z-Boy Inc.)

If you don't know how to do that, then you might sell your stocks too early because you got scared off, or hesitate to buy - and then miss a huge run-up. That's especially important when your stocks go down in value and you start seeing a ton of red in your account..

Here are three quotes that really helped me get control of my mental game. Each of them covers a slightly different aspect. Read them, understand them, combine them in your mind, and your profits should get a lot better. :)

**First, this long but awesome quote from Warren Buffett, all the way back in his 1987 letter to shareholders:**

""Ben Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.

Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.

Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you. But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.

Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy. An investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.”

**Second, the famous Litany Against Fear from Dune, one of the best sci-fi books of all time:**

""I must not fear.

Fear is the mind-killer.

Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face my fear.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""

**Last but not least, my personal favourite - by Covetous Shen from Diablo-3. :)**

""Hope... Do not look down, my friend. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. Hope for a better day, hope for a new dawn. Or just hope for a good breakfast. You start small, then see what you can get.""

Good luck - I hope this helped you.

This is my opinion based on hard lessons learned while reading charts. Take with a grain of salt my opinions, feel free to watch them and test them as the next week unfolds.This is a situation as the markets close for week of Jun-14.This is my bulls and bears going into Monday June 21.

AAPL - Weak-Bear: with how it is trending it looks like AAPL finished in a trading range. If bearish signals continue into next week expect a break-out down in price.  
AAPL 45min chart - Strong bull very weakened.

ABBV - weakening bear but also very weak bull signal. Tie goes to bear. Starting to trade flat. Maybe would have traded up Monday but I expect it to be down due to market sentiment.
ABBV 45min chart - strong bear little change. 

BAC - Weak Bull. See JPM. Looks weaker than JPM but banks are trending together. It entered bull territory today but at great cost. Almost overbought on the RSI (67.25) just for slight MACD bull-signals (+0.02)  
BAC 45min chart - Strong bear weakening.

CVX - See XOM (about the same analysis).

DIS - Weakly Bearish maybe bullish. I did a trendline analysis on this one because it's uniquely problematic. It has a sharp downtrend beginning about June 15 that confuses you at first glance. June 17 and 18 both branch above this trendline. If you move the opening-down to the same price as the previous day you can see that the price is trading almost flat off the trend line. That is actually a strong reversal indicator. If DIS is weakly bearish it may suffer with market downturn. However, it may flat line rather than fall and seems poised for a reversal.  
DIS 45min chart - Strong bear weakening.

JPM  - Weak Bear trending toward Bull. Be hesitant. Signs of reversal include bear weakening to bull and pulling away from trend on low volume, plus bursts of increasing volume day overall. Tough call, it's basically evenly matched bear-to-bull but that's an improvement from last 2 weeks.  
JPM 45min chart - strong bear weakening.

MSFT - Very weak bull possibly crossed into bear territory. No trend yet. I say ""tie goes to the bears"" and MSFT's bulls today tied with the bears. Because of this MSFT is probably slipping into hibernation for early in the next week.  
MSFT 45min chart - Strong bull weakening.

TSLA - Midsized-Bear: TSLA entered bear signals today. Historically TSLA has 3-4 days of bear for 1-2 days of bull. TSLA price finished strong but this is a weak bull run testing resistance. It will likely fall Monday and continue to fall as long as the bearish signal remains.  
TSLA 45min chart - mid to strong bull. This counters its current bearish tendencies so I expect it to lose some price, and come off that bottom for another run. Give it a few days.

VZ - Weak bull. It's been in the weak bear territory where tie goes to the bear so the price has slumped slowly each day. But the bear was weakening and has basically turned into a weak bull today.  
VZ 45min Chart - It was a strengthening weak bear, but drop in opening price June 18 skews the chart a bit, so I'd say it's a Strong Bear Weakening. But it's more likely due to low volume on the drop in price. Price is trending up, 5min chart suggests weak bull finish. I'd say it's in a good position for next week.

XOM - Strong Bear. Steep down trend with price matching trend on low volume to confirm the trend.  
XOM 45min chart - Strong Bear strengthening."|investing|Bulls and the Bears for week of Jun-21|9.0|0.7

Due to a recent surge in this sort of activity I'm putting out in the public a stance /r/investing has held for some time.  This post will be linked in the rules for future clarification needs.   

Ever since the GME fiasco Reddit has been the site of an unprecedented amount of deliberate manipulation, bad faith interaction, and attempted pumping.  Because we are one of the larger financial subreddits we have had to deal with this front on - and we have stuck to our longstanding policy regarding brigading.  

In the last two weeks we have banned over 300 users tied to at least 7 different subreddits for this behavior.  I don't know what the fuck is going on but for whatever reason everyone forgot how to interact like an adult on Reddit in the last three months so here we are.  This is an investment sub, we talk about boring shit like stocks, bonds, markets, whatever - none of us have to be dealing with this subredditdrama style nonsense.  It's fucking childish. 

**First, a bit of history for the new users**

This policy dates back to mid 2013, in the origional Crypto craze there was a concerted effort by bad actors to establish subreddits focused on their new altcoin or cryptocurrency, then organize a brigade of various investment subreddits.  We reached out to the moderators of /r/cryptocurrency and they added our sub to their filters to prevent this sort of behavior from becoming an issue.  The admins also removed a few users and crypto subs that were created for this purpose.  

Hedgefundaspirations, Crasymike, a few older investment mods, and I held a policy way back then (Even before I was a mod here, and prior to this account even) of permanently banning anyone who participated in this activity.  The point here, is this is not a new policy, it's not reactive to any recent market events, and it's not going away.  We are not concerned with whether something is accurate, inaccurate, etc, we are not taking a pro/con stance on any given security or investment - we are taking a definitive stance against such bad faith interaction as we always have since the very early days of this sub. 

---------

**The Policy**

The moment we determine that a brigade is occurring we will automatically and permanently ban anyone who participated in that brigade.  No questions asked, and no appeals given outside of very rare circumstances.  We will also remove the topic, lock comments, and potentially examine the idea of preventing any discussion on that topic for some time - regardless of if it may be a good faith question.   

**What is a brigade?**

Any attempt to gather members of a different subreddit, especially one focused on a specific security, investment, or stance, to come to /r/investing and do any of the following: 

 - Educate the posters

 - Correct ""FUD""

 - ""Share information"" about a given security

 - Correct some perception of bad actors - if you have reason to believe people in our sub are acting in bad faith then contact the moderation team.  DO NOT go post in some sub taking the opposite stance to gather reinforcements. 

 - Share your stance/opinion, or information you believe to be true.

**In short: if you are on a subreddit that is focused on a specific security, investment, or stance and you see someone there reference a post on /r/investing (link, a screen shot, a comment saying ""this is happening over at /r/investing, whatever), then you go post on /r/investing to express your stance you are getting a ban.**  If you spend all day in a subreddit focused on a given security, investment, or stance and you happen to ""innocently"" come across a post here on that subject you had better make absolutely sure nobody in the offending sub has mentioned /r/investing yet - because you're getting lumped in with brigaders if not.  

I want to be very transparent about this - we do not care what you posted.  It could be a profane rant or a kind hearted link to a reputable source.  We care that you are participating in a broad bad faith engagement on Reddit.  After we lock/remove the thread we are able to see which users came from the offending sub very easily - and they will all get a ban.  

**Just to be clear:** 

This is not brigading: a post in /r/valueinvesting pointing out an interesting discussion on /r/investing, and users coming over to participate.  We are happy to facilitate good faith interaction between various communities.

I this case, it is what they are calling a Reserved Share Program.  My understanding is that generally, IPOs are only for large investors but this is a special program where users of the company's product(s) are afforded the opportunity to get in for a much smaller amount of initial investment than would usually be needed for an IPO.  Think of the program that Uber and Lyft had for their drivers.  (Not sure if it's relevant, but the company in question is Doximity, a social media platform for physicians and limited other healthcare professionals.  An estimated 10k-20k of its most active users were invited to participate with a minimum investment of \~$100 and a max of \~$5000.)

I've read the preliminary prospectus in pretty good detail and looked at the financials, and it seems to be a pretty strong company that is already profitable and looking to expand. Of course, as anyone who is a physician knows, any salesman that screams ""I have an investment opportunity for physicians only!"" is just looking for suckers, but the way Doximity reached out to us really seemed more of a ""Here's something we'd like to do for you for being among our first users to say thanks.  No pressure, and we won't be offended if you say no.""  I'm approaching this as a gamble moreso than an exercise in investing, but the opportunity to grow a small chunk of change literally overnight is quite appealing.

The rest of this post is all theoretical discussion based on previous trends.  This is a great time for the disclaimers for both ""past results do not guarantee future performance"" and ""don't try to time the market.""  Once again, I am not approaching this as investing. but more of an exercise in what I should do, statistically speaking.  (I would also argue that I'm not timing the market, just a single stock.)  My research shows that statistically speaking, a stock ""pops"" on average 20-40% on the first day of trading after an IPO.  Tech IPOs tend to fare a bit better.  Obviously there are risks as with every investment and it seems that about 10-20% either don't make significant gains on the first day or actually lose value.  However, my research does not show at what point do things ""peak"" during all of this volatility.

For example: At 6pm, the night before the IPO (day 0), I have to decide how much shares I want at the offering price.  (I have no lockup period, some employees and institutional investors do is my understanding ranging from anything from 3 days to \~1 month when the earnings report comes out).  Statistically speaking, does the ""pop"" happen as soon as the market opens on Day 1?  Sometime during the day? A day or two after?

Once again, caveats abound (if IPOs were guaranteed to make money, everyone and their brother would be getting in on it!), but this seems like something I'd like to get involved in to learn a bit, for the novelty of the situation, and the chance to make a quick buck in a company I believe in and who has made my professional lief a bit easier in more ways than one.

Apollo is managing $323 billion in their credit division whereas Blackstone isn’t even managing half that in their credit division. 

The reason I bring this up is because of raising rates in 2022 (presumably). Raising rates are obviously not good for LBO firms, but since Apollo has almost 70% of their AUM in their credit division doesn’t that mean they’d actually kind of benefit from raising rates?

Their information gathering process seemed very similar to the ones used by regular news outlets to discover shady business practices, interviewing former employees and examining hard-to-find information. Furthermore, as far as I could tell, this appeared to be totally legal.

My question is, why don’t news companies do the same thing as Hindenburg when they discover similarly damaging information about a public company?

I’ve reviewed several past threads and responses and while they help, I think I’m just being dense and need to ask this in my own way. Here is an overly simplified example that may make no sense. Any help would be appreciated.

If I have $150 in my account and I want to buy 1 share of a company that is trading at $200. Assuming I have a margin account, I can either wait until I have the extra $50 or I can buy the 1 share at $200 by spending my $150 and borrowing $50. Basically, what are the possible outcomes that can happen at this point? 

I get that if the value of the account drops below a certain amount, a margin call will be issued and I have to put up the additional cash or have assets liquidated to bring the account value up. I get that. Where I guess I’m unsure is how the leveraged money is treated in other scenarios i.e. when is it no longer considered debt and how distribution of profits/ paying back debt are handled. 

So if I do the above mentioned trade, how does adding additional funds over time play out? If the stock either remains at its price or increases in value and I add say $200 to it the next month, does $50 of that go to pay off the leveraged amount leaving me with $150 spent and no remaining debt for the leveraged $50? 
Alternatively, if the original share I purchased for $200 ($150 my money + $50 borrowed) increases in value to $250, can the gains be used to pay back the broker leaving me with $200 of the stock without debt?

I saw today that Trading 212 made changes to their terms and conditions on the Invest account. In Chapter 22, it states the platform may lend your shares to 3rd parties, and those shares are covered to 102% of the value from what I understand.

So my guess is that due to the potential short squeezes in GME / AMC this change has come to play now at least on the T212 platform (I know other platforms had this before). So I would assume hedge funds could be among the third parties able to borrow the shares, essentially giving them more ammunition to play with messing around with the price! 

I’m guessing it’s a strategy to minimise the financial damage to the organisations that are gonna be hit by the short squeezes... What about us retail investors though, how are we gonna be hit by this when the hedge funds have to return the shares, and what if it gets to the point that they can’t return those shares and go bust? I’m curious about that 102% value on the share. Luckily I have majority of my shares in the ISA - which I don’t believe is affected by this.... I know those shares are safe for everyone in invest, but at what return value is what I’m investigating. 

I’m new to this, and I might be interpreting this wrong...but this seems to be saying the shares we have in Invest can be lent out to any third parties, and if they can’t pay them back then we are covered up to 102% of the value so the stocks are safe - I’m curious if that’s the value we purchased them at, or the 102% is a value updated on a daily basis on the stocks worth at that time in the market?

Hopefully someone more clued up than me can share some thoughts for everyone! Maybe it’s not even a big deal, but I’d be really interested to hearing some of the more experienced peoples thoughts as I’m still learning.

   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent’s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps, WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.
   * **It’s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I’ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate
   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay
* **Gaming**
   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent’s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**
   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue
      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**
      * Another important thing to note is that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns roughly **70% market share** of the gaming market
   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given that it’s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China’s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)
      * So basically, if you’re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App
      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game
   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China’s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)
   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world’s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard
* **Tencent’s investment portfolio**
   * First of all, it’s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company’s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing
   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla
      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent’s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**
      * A large part of Tencent’s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down

**The Bull Case**

* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**
   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren’t disclosed in Tencent’s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020
   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it’ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth
* In order to not be too repetitive, I won’t touch upon gaming and Tencent’s investment portfolio
* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**
   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China’s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge
   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment
   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent’s gaming business**
* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**
   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent’s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021
   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014
      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more
      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I’m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**
   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**
   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent’s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**
   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air
* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**
   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**
   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power
   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent’s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact
* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**
   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok
   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we’ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless
   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent’s gaming dominance
   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**
* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**
   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don’t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency
   * I don’t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind
   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk

**Financials &amp; Valuation**

* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf) (refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid
   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn’t matter
   * For instance, the company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that
* Regarding valuation, I’ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&amp;name=large) and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)
   * Amongst the Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent’s revenue growth is in the middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**
   * This along with Tencent’s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**
   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**
   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**
* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I’d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety
* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)
   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies
   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent’s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon

**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it’d be great to hear your thoughts."|investing|Tencent Deep Dive Analysis - Amazing Company to Keep an Eye On|19.0|0.64

TLDR: Company with lots of cash, good profit margins, steady profits and cash flows. Net of cash, it is trading around 4x four year average profits.

The company started as and, to a large extent, still is game developer to IP owners. Claim to fame is Dragon Balls Z whose IP is owned by Bandai Namco. It derives majority of revenues from various versions of this game.

Obviously it developed few other games but no blockbusters so far, not even sleeper hits. There are some in pipeline but no one knows if they can become big. (Risk 1)

Revenue has been pretty stagnant for last 12 quarters. But costs going up slowly as company is hiring more people to develop own IP and games. (Extension of risk 1)

In an effort of ""related diversification"" went into physical gaming arenas and ticketing. This only bloated cost structure, particularly with Covid impact. (Risk 2)

As with every other gaming company with one successful game and steady cash flows, it is fashioning itself as incubator of game developers and even launched a fund to invest in other gaming and content companies. (Risk 3)

It has been betting on India for both kids entertainment IP and games and been investing in local mobile game companies. (Extension of risk 3)

Entire market is at all time highs and this stock at one year low. (Risk 4) This needs a major catalyst for it to budge. 

While no cure to risks 1&amp;3, at least predictable in advance, they did reduce fixed costs associated with risk 2.

Now to good parts:
1. Has valuation of 52 billion yen vs cash of 28 bn yen as on 31 March 2021.
2. Highly profitable with good operating cash flows

3. Generally cash on balance sheet doesn't mean anything to investors as managements find creative ways to destroy it. This company also been down that path. Only partially course corrected even now. But is finally getting serious about returning cash to investors. In addition to continuing dividends, it announced buybacks for 3.57% of outstanding stock. That too at a good time as price has been beaten down. Has already carried out 40% of it in last 1 month.

4. The buybacks will cost 1.8-2 bn yen. Post adjusting for buybacks, cash on balance sheet will be 26 bn and market cap will be 50 bn. The numbers come to same even if I account for current assets and liabilities. Remaining value is 24 bn against which company generates 6 bn yen profit after tax it has been generating in each of last 4 years. Meaning  4x PE.

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials signaled they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March, as the economy recovers rapidly from the effects of the pandemic and inflation heats up.

Their median projection showed they anticipate lifting their benchmark rate to 0.6% from near zero by the end of 2023. In March they had expected to hold it steady through that year.
Prompting the policy shift is a much stronger economic rebound and hotter inflation than the Fed anticipated just a few months ago.

“Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid-19 in the United States,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting. “Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.”

In updated projections released Wednesday 13 of 18 officials indicated they expect to lift short-term rates by the end of 2023, up from seven who expected that outcome in March. In March, most of them anticipated holding rates steady through 2023.

The Fed has held overnight interest rates steady since March 2020, when the effects of the pandemic caused the sharpest economic contraction in generations. The central bank also has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds since June 2020 to hold down longer-term borrowing costs, providing further support to the recovery.

The Fed reiterated that it expects to continue bond purchases until “substantial further progress” has been made in the recovery.

Fed officials want the economy to get closer to their goals of “maximum employment” and sustained, 2% inflation before reducing the bond purchases. They have said they want to fully achieve those objectives before they raise interest rates.

Since officials’ previous meeting, in April, the labor market’s progress has been somewhat slower than they had anticipated. Employers added 837,000 jobs in April and May, leaving total employment 7.6 million jobs shy of pre-pandemic levels.

Policy makers have become less confident in recent weeks the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Some 2.6 million people retired between February 2020 and April, according to estimates from the Dallas Fed. A steadily aging U.S. population suggests limited scope for reversing that trend, some economists say.

In contrast, inflation has been higher than expected. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index rose 5% in May from a year earlier.

That inflation rate, the highest since 2008, makes the Fed uncomfortable, even if officials believe it reflects mostly temporary factors that should fade later this year. They worry that if inflation exceeds 2% too much or for too long, it might lead businesses and consumers to anticipate more inflation in the future, which can become self-fulfilling. Evidence of rising inflation expectations would likely require the Fed to tighten policy sooner or more aggressively than planned to re-anchor those expectations around 2%."|investing|Federal Reserve now expect to raise rates by the end of 2023, rather than hold them near zero.|1601.0|0.97

There are people that have been trading for a few months that don't even know how to read an income statement or what is market cap, that suddenly sell themselves as experts and do what they believe to be sohisticated securities and market analysis, when in reality they are just glancing at a few lines on a chart or some text they don't understand and using it to confirm their bias. They live in this populist made-up reality where the world owes them something because they are oppressed and they are convinced that they predicted a global financial collapse when in reality they are just being played by market makers and heavily indebted companies that are trying to save themselves raising capital by issuing new shares. 

Then there's the crypto blokes, that know blockchain so well they probably never actually used it. They can't even recognize that all these coins including the big ones have almost zero use cases. You think these tokens are really going to become money, even with scalability problems that have remained unsolved for decades and a market that is easily maniuplated by falsely backed stablecoins issuers and a few exchanges? Do you actually believe these  charlatans  when no serious economist has ever said anything good about it?

Even the guys and gals that are supposed to teach the average user personal finance just follow this mantra of buying and holding NASDAQ ETFs like they're the holy grail of investing, even if we are almost at an historic all time high in terms of valuations, even if everybody has forgotten that stocks are risky: I would like to see these people deal with crashes like 2000, 2009  or even with something similar to Japan.

Let's price in the next centuries of earnings into every EV company.

That's why everyone, -and I say EVERYONE **including institutions**\- scouts this website everyday just to find out what the next meme is going to be. ""What's the next worthless thing retail's going to pump this week? Just so I can get quickly in and out before it collapses"" ... since it's backed by zero fundamentals. It's a toxic and disgusting and opportunistic behaviour and it's a clear symptom of the presence of specuative fever in the markets.

If transient inflation is the best case scenario, we should understand what that means. 

Inflation can be transitory in absolute terms or rate of change terms. In the absolute case, prices would briefly spike and then come back down to the same level that they were before. In the rate of change case, prices would briefly spike and then stop increasing, but stay at that higher level in the long term.

Historically, inflation has almost always been transient in rate of change terms. So when you hear Powell telling you not to worry because inflation is transitory - just know that means that prices will stop going up soon, but they will remain at elevated levels. 

Of course there are extreme supply chain cases such as lumber where prices will come back down, but these cases are the exception, not the rule. Generally across the board, the inflation that we see will be caused by an expansion in the money supply.

It looks convincing to me. In the past 3 years, growth companies' multiples have increased so much that today they are worth twice the P / E shares on average. At the same time, for at least 10 years before this, the premium for growth shares was 20-40%.

When will this trend reverse if not now? We are finally getting out of the pandemic, the restrictions are lifted, the real economy is reviving, which means that the value of business companies should grow in 2021. In addition, rates and inflation are growing. This is both a minus for growth companies (funding is more expensive) and a plus for companies of value (an increase in prices for their goods).

The subtlety is that there are many different value companies. Today, the situation is positive for all of them, but somewhere the potential has already been won back, and somewhere it is not too great.

For example, producers of oil, gas, coal and raw materials have already received high marks in the stock market. Everyone sees high prices for raw materials and purchases of shares in raw materials companies did not take long.

But the shares of companies producing consumer goods and food have not really grown. Their potential is not so great, but they fit perfectly into an inflation defense strategy. Their revenues are also positively influenced by packages of assistance to the population from the state and the acceleration of inflation. They also provide the population with essential goods. Even if these goods become more expensive, the population continues to buy them.

There are also banks. Their stocks are showing a phenomenal rebound. Look, for example, at Wells Fargo stocks (https://www.google.com/search?q=well+fargo+stock&amp;oq=well+fa&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i20i263j0l4j0i20i263j0l3.3487j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). x2 in 4.5 months. This growth is due solely to the growth in rates. Even last summer, it seemed that banks would issue all loans in dollars at 0%. Now the situation is different. If rates continue to rise, bank shares will continue to rise.

Box 8: EV sector up with NASDAQ, TSLA underperforms

Box 9: EV sector outperforms NASDAQ, mainly sideways, slightly down

Box 10: Same as box 9

Box 11: EV sector underperforms against the NASDAQ, TSLA underperforms

Box 12: EV sector underperforms against the NASDAQ, TSLA and NIO outperform the sector but still underperform against the NASDAQ

Today: NASDAQ and EV sector died, ARVL and RIDE up, not sure what happened with ARVL but RIDE is getting funded by GM so they aren't going broke.

I want to offer a different perspective - not only these rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future, but these are the normal rates for the future and a reflection of real changes in the world and not some artificial manipulation by central banks.  


To explain this, we need to go back to the basics. What is an interest rate? It's a ""future consumption discount"", in other words how much money would it take to convince a person with money to spend it in the future rather than today. For example (and to use simple values), if the rate is 10% annual, then if I had 100 dollars today, someone would have to pay me 110 dollars a year from now to lend them the money today.  


So let's examine what impacts these rates, or in other words what makes me require more or less payment a year from now to not spend the money today. There are lots of different factors, but it mainly comes down to uncertainty.... the less certain I am about the future, the more money later I would need to not spend it today. For example... if I knew the world was ending in a month, no amount of money in the world would convince me not to spend it today on something nice. On the other hand, if I knew for sure things would be great a year from now, and not only that, but there might be stuff available in a year that isn't even available today (like a new car, or phone...) it would take much less to persuade me to wait that year... perhaps I would be even ok with losing some money and still wait.  


Ok, so interest rates are measure of uncertainty, more uncertainty means higher rates and vice versa. So when we talk about historical rates we can also talk about historical uncertainty and see how it matches up. Just to provide 3 data points, let's look at 1980 (\~13% rate), 1990 (\~9% rate) and 2021 (\~1.5% rate)   


Here is the thing ... the world in 2021 is much much safer and more certain than in 1990 or 1980. In 1980 the world was one mistake and button push away from total destruction (google 1983 able archer). Most Western economies were in deep multi-year ruts. Soviets were invading Afghanistan and US was sending weapons to their opponents there.   


1990 was much saner... Berlin Wall was down, Reaganomics (and it's variants around the world) started to pull Western economies toward more growth.  Volcker's Fed shown that inflation can be defeated and controlled. But threats still remained, Germany was not yet unified, people were concerned with nuclear weapons ""lost"" in Russia etc.  


And finally we skip to 2021. Nuclear threat is no longer a serious concern. We made it through 2009 and the economists have shown that they can manage and control deflation as well as inflation. The world survived a world scale pandemic with (relatively) minor damage and in fact has proven that it can function reasonably well despite all of it. Air travel is safe. We are close to making driving perfectly safe too. The biggest international challenge is China because they copied some of our ideas. Not ideal, but nowhere near the threat that USSR was. Tech is developing so rapidly that it actually makes sense to wait a bit to get the new stuff rather than buying something that will be obsolete in couple years today.  


So from that point of view, interest rates / uncertainty near zero make sense. What about the future? Well, outside of climate change threat (and even that seem to be fairly well contained from the world perspective, even if it will hurt specific areas more than others), there doesn't seem to be all that much to worry about. So low uncertainty about future means low interest rates for as far as the eye can see. This is the new normal and it's good because it means we live in a safe sane predictable world."|investing|Interest Rates as a measure of Risk|9.0|0.6

DISCLAIMER: I am a holder of SFT stock. Not meant as financial advice, just trying to provide some information and create some discussion around this company.

Positions: 210 shares @ $7.06 and some November 19th 7.5$ calls (purchased a while back)

Shift technologies, ticker $SFT - Current share price: $8.46 (as of close 14th June) - Market cap: 704.289M

So, before I start most things I could even write here are covered by an excellent DD video found on youtube by TheWalrus Street (I highly recommend his channel). I can't post the link but it's easy to find on youtube and provides all the basic information you need about this company.

To keep it short, Shift technologies is a company specializing in online used vehicle sales. They buy cars and re-sell them through their website. They are currently only active in a few states in the USA but are rapidly expanding.

Recently there have been quite a few developments for the company.

Shift technologies released its 1st quarter earnings report on May 13th and it was pretty damn good.

\- Revenue grew to $106.0 million up 254% YOY

\- Gross profit grew to $7.4 million or 6.9% of total revenue, up from $3.3 million.

\- Gross profit per unit was $1,655, growing 255% from $466 in Q4'2020

\- Net loss was $42.8 million as compared to net loss of $12.3 million a year prior.

Increase in net loss is mainly attributable to an increase in marketing expenses and slight increase in SG&amp;A expenses. However, margins are increasing significantly (255% increase in margins on vehicles quarter over quarter) and revenue is as well. It makes sense that their operating expenses are increasing as they will have to act aggressively in order to be able to take market-share from both Carvana and Vroom.

So this quarter was pretty good, but I believe that the next quarter will be even better considering that according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics April saw the biggest increase in inflation for used verhicles, going up by 10% which is the highest it has been since 1953. See the link below for a bloomberg article covering this:

[Bloomberg article on Inflation in used vehicles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/record-surge-in-used-car-prices-is-key-culprit-in-inflation-jump)

More recently on May 24th an offering of senior notes of 75 million was announced, which they increased to 125 million the next day. The share price dropped as low as $6.26 intraday on the 24th but has seen a steady climb back upwards ever since. With this happening I'm also pretty confident that further offerings will not happen in the near future.

There has also been some insider purchasing of shares. Oded Shein the CFO of the company bought $70k worth of shares at $7.00. Although this seems insignificant it's generally a bullish sign for insiders to be purchasing shares.

Finally, $SFT will be added to the Russell 3000 on June 25th. The list of companies that are going to be uplisted was announced the 4th of june. For the full list see the link below so you can check it out for yourself.

[Preliminary additions to the Russell 3000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf)

This isn't a major catalyst or anything but it does mean that funds tracking the index will have to start adding some shares in order to rebalance their indexes. This could already have happened in anticipation of the uplisting ofcourse, so I wouldn't put too much value on it.

Since I last posted this in r/stocks the CPI report for May was also released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and once again used vehicles saw the highest inflation amongst all categories at 7.3 percent.Looking back at May last year this makes for an increase in the prices of used vehicles of around 30 percent in just 1 year.[Article about the increase in prices in used cars over the last year.](https://www.cars.com/articles/used-car-prices-spiked-30-in-just-one-year-436989/)

Considering their rapid growth trajectory I can see their revenue increasing even more over the next quarters. Even if they have four consecutive 106.0 million revenue quarters that puts them at a P/S ratio of around 1.6 (P/S ratio using sales last year is currently 3.5 for SFT). Their main competitors, Vroom and Carvana have P/S ratio of 3.75 and 7.01 (based on revenues of last year).

I think SFT provides value in two ways: they are rapidly growing in a market that isn't fully developed yet and they are profiting from enormous amounts of inflation in used vehicles which ultimately should affect their bottomline positively (assuming they are able to use this inflation to improve their margins as well and are not just paying the same amount extra for the cars they acquire from customers).

To me SFT seems undervalued, but I would love to hear your thought and opinions.

My gains and losses were both high and basically cancelled each other out. The stress was not worth it.

After that I decided to look back into more slow, set-it-and-forget-it style investments. I really like the compounding nature of moderately high, frequent dividends coupled with a DRIP. But I am also fairly young and can afford a little risk and would like to see some value growth as well. So this has led me to having a portfolio that is fairly REIT heavy (about 40%).

Now my question is, assuming that even fairly conservative index funds average about \~6% returns per year, does it make mathematical sense to maximize margin if the rate is lower than this return?

I''ve been holding ERJ since $9.22. Originally, I had a 16 dollar price target, which was met last week when the Eve Air Mobility deal was announced. 

It looks like ERJ is talking about doing a SPAC for this division of the company. 

I'm not educated on SPACs, but common sense says this would peel Eve Air out of ERJ and make a separate ticker, right? Or not?

So, a couple of questions here- (Forgive my ignorance on this one. I'm trying to learn and Dr. Google isn't helping.)


1. If ERJ does do a SPAC, would current ERJ shareholders get any kind of stake? Like let's say 10% of shares go over to the spac? Or, would ERJ shareholders just be left with fond memories of what might have been?

2. If ERJ is in the SPAC, does this mean that both ERJ and the SPAC benefit financially, or would all funds pour into the SPAC?

3. At the current price point, we are sitting right around prepandemic levels and the company is slowly getting back to normal as air travel resumes and business gets back to traveling in Q3 2021. 
ERJ has been fairly immune to the crazy price swings we saw in April, so I'm trying to decide if I should hold a little longer and haven't been able to find any information about when a current ticker splits into a SPAC.

Is the investing world ready for yet another next-generation fintech going public? Acorns, an investing app that offers a suite of investment, banking, and financial education services for low monthly fees, revealed it's going public by combining with an existing company, Pioneer Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:PACX). The company said this places the equity value of its business at roughly $2.2 billion.

Pioneer Merger is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which is an entity created and listed with the sole purpose of bringing an existing business to the stock market quickly.

Two people gazing at their respective smartphones.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
After Acorns fuses together with Pioneer Merger, the new entity will operate as Acorns Holdings. Its stock should trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol OAKS. Current Acorns CEO Noah Kerner will also be at the helm of the new company. 

Acorns said that Kerner and Pioneer Merger's sponsor aim to pass along 10% of their respective positions in the new company to eligible customers through a share-ownership program. It didn't provide details of this initiative.

In its press release trumpeting the move, Acorns quoted Kerner as saying that, ""Going public will help elevate our story, introduce many more people to the power of compounding and financial wellness, and bring financial literacy to the mainstream.""

Acorns said that both its and Pioneer Merger's board of directors have unanimously approved their business combination. It remains subject to approval by the latter company's shareholders. Acorns said the deal should close in the second half of this year.

While the publicly traded, cutting-edge fintech space is getting quite crowded, Acorns has a novel business profile and operates a popular app. This should attract plenty of attention from investors looking to profit on the future of the financial services industry."|investing|Acorns Investing App Going Public in $2.2 Billion SPAC Merger|30.0|0.74

Ali-Urman  By Ali Urman | @aurmanARK
Analyst

This week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Biogen’s Aducanumab, a drug targeting amyloid plaque buildup in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. As many families know all too well, Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease during which patients can lose both their memories and their abilities to perform daily tasks. 

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of people aged 65+ suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in the US will nearly triple during the next 50 years, from an estimated 5.8 million people today to 14 million in 2060.  

The approval of Aducanumab was surprising for several reasons:

Broad Label: Doctors will be able to prescribe Aducanumab for any Alzheimer’s patients whether they suffer from mild or severe forms of the disease. This broad label was a surprise because the clinical trial included only patients suffering from a mild form of Alzheimer’s.

Cost: Aducanumab will cost $56,000 annually, a high sticker price given its low efficacy.

Toxicity: In its approval, the FDA seemed to place little to no emphasis on toxicity, which is puzzling because Alzheimer’s patients will have difficulty communicating ill effects to their families and care givers.

Clinical Benefit: Biogen will have nine years to complete the trial and demonstrate that Aducanumab delivers clinical benefit.

Imaging Requirements: By the end of their first year on Aducanumab, patients will have to undergo an MRI instead of a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to confirm beta-amyloid, the drug’s target.

Advisors: Three of the nine advisors on the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee - Aaron Kesselheim, Joel Perlmutter, and David Knopman – stepped down following the approval.

If the FDA seems to be approving therapeutic agents targeted at diseases with high unmet needs before confirmatory trials end, we believe the value of other such therapies showing little clinical efficacy could be much higher than most investors expect."|investing|Did FDA err in approving Biogen’s Aducanumab drug in treating Alzheimer’s disease?

Valvoline.  The boomer stock you never knew you needed in your life and portfolio.

It's a really old company... founded in 1866... the year after the end of the Civil War (US).  So super well established... your parents and grandparents probably went there to get their cars serviced.

So why am I talking about this boomer stock?

They are poised to grow significantly over the next year with everyone getting back on the road and needing more servicing... I wish I had gotten into VVV last year, but it is still early for the growth they can achieve over the next year and beyond.

From late 2019 through early 2021 they have been rolling out new product lines and services for electric vehicles.  Since people are having trouble getting their older EVs to centers for servicing, this is an area of the market ripe for entry.  And Valvoline is poised and poising to do just this.


Background:

VVV manufactures, markets, and supplies, engine and automotive maintenance products and services.

It operates Valvoline instant oil change service centers. It operates and franchises over 1,500 quick-lube locations in the United States and Canada. They also serve car dealers, general repair shops, and third-party quick lube locations, as well as through distributors. 

VVV operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America.

Sector: Material

Industry: Chemicals



Earnings:

They have consistently beaten expectations since q2 2019... including during all of 2020!  I think rules for r/investing prohibit images so you can easily look this data up.


Analysis:

For analyst opinions, out of the 13 firms with opinions, here is the breakdown:

Outperform - 2

Buy - 4

Neutral - 6

Underperform - 1

And then when you only look at independent analyst firms:

Outperform - 2

Buy - 1

Neutral - 5



The vast majority of stock is institutionally owned...

Shares outstanding: 181,078,000

Market Cap: $6.24 B

Institutional ownership: 94.86%

Top owners?  Vanguard and Blackrock.  Combined these two own over a billion dollars worth of VVV.  Probably because it pays dividends and is a super stable company with good financial data and potential for growth over the next year.


Volume is very low: 90-day average volume is only 1,378,434.  No one is selling, and there is a slight dip today marking perhaps an opportunity to get in before the next upswing.  If you like bollinger bands, take a look at the past few months... Bullish. (Again, no images here I think, you can look this up easily as well)



**TL;DR:**

VVV is a stable company with good financials, plans for growth to support the growing EV market, and tons of locations throughout North America for great positioning for general re-opening as everyone gets back on the roads.  On top of all that, the stock has been climbing for the past year steadily with positive reviews moving forward.  



This is not a meme stock, and not a pump and dump.  This is a company with good fundamentals and opportunity for growth.  Re-opening will have more people on the road... and no one knows how to service their own cars anymore, let alone EVs.  Valvoline will grow consistently over the next year and beyond.  I am going long with shares and leaps.



Cheers!

**Fair warning:** Google Sheets struggles with large amounts of data and a lot of people logging in, so I created multiples of each spreadsheet. If you have trouble getting in all I can recommend is continuing to try. If you do, make a copy for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summaries:**

* **Easiest to gather data: Millenial Bets**. This is a straight copy/paste. The others required a lot of Excel copy, pasting, sorting, etc to get it to fit into the sheets
* **Best average returns: Millenial Bets.** This may be because they had the biggest quantity of results. It's hard to narrow this down to just a few tickers to buy, so looks good as a paper trader but hard to put into use in the real world
* **Best at returning a small list of tickers to buy: Dayminer.** This data narrows down to just a few, or sometimes none, per day. But the ones that do hit tend to hit pretty consistently

&amp;#x200B;

**End Results from tracking the data:** *(When paper trading I chose categories that had a % of Profitable vs Non-Profitable returns of greater than 90%. I was aiming for highest success rate of being profitable)*

**How do I use this data?** This is the question I get asked the most often. Here's what I do:

1. Every morning before market open I copy the data from the scrapers, do whatever post-processing I need to do to get it to fit into the sheets, then paste into the sheets. This captures all the sentiment data from the last 24 hours
2. When I'm ready to buy something I look at the highest profitability categories in the data crunching tabs
3. From there I narrow down THAT DAY'S list of tickers based on the highest profitability categories
4. I'll do a quick search on Reddit to see if overall sentiment is bullish or bearish. If everyone looks hopeful I'll buy
5. I look at the average % returns and the average number of days to get there and those are my exit points

1. Some people are claiming that I cherry-picked data by leveraging the last 5 years of raging bull market. I am aware that this was a particularly good time period for stocks, and have explicitly acknowledged this issue in the original post itself. This strat also works over the [life of data](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/options) (**2010-2021)** that is available to me. This 11 year period includes the 2020 flash crash, Aug'11 bear market, 2015-16 China crash/US markets selloff, 2018 crypto crash, and 2020 covid crash. 
2. Testing over 2007-2008 would have been great, and I concur with many of you that if markets stayed flat over 2 years, this strat loses substantial capital. This is also acknowledged in the original post. I'm not claiming this to be some strat with [huuuge upside and very little downside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXLV_DMKa0), just an interesting way to deploy leverage. 
3. Backtests do not guarantee future success. They only prove that a strat would have worked in the past. This is true of backtests that are statistically significant AND of those that aren't. My philosophy is that if you're going to gamble, use all the data you have to optimize your odds, and do it as scientifically as possible. I'm working towards adding a hedging component. All research will be open-sourced. If you have any constructive ideas for reducing drawdowns/ruin probability and such please DM

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tl;dr: DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets. Crazy right?

Disclaimer: This isn't financial advice. I am not a finance professional.

Who this is for: This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE, who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years, and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly. Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market *total* returns - not *risk adjusted* returns (hate that term by the way) or more correctly not *volatility adjusted* returns. If this doesn't describe you, this post won't be useful to you.

""Dollar cost average into index funds"" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up.

Then the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. ""guarantee"" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so?

I could think of 3 ways:

1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and [documented](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5934). I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk, margin requirement change risk, flash crash risk. Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate (that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for) is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They'll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method.
2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they're not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color.
3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying.  This is the subject of this post

Research methodology:

I backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s.

Investing in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs.

Leverage is set to 1. We won't be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient.

No stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that's closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194.

Why 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I'm sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I'd just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it's as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that's the least of our concerns.

Inb4 ""short term capital gain taxes"" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with ""buy and hold index"" or ""dollar cost average index"" on a pre as well as post tax basis.

Finally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we're not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that's okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done.

Backtest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun'16 to Jun'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don't have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a *sufficiently large and flexible* time period.

Results:

[https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY](https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY)

[https://ibb.co/frswZJn](https://ibb.co/frswZJn)

**Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75%**

**Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49%** (benchmark#1)

**Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57%** (benchmark#2)

Worst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2%

Sharpe ratio - 1.23

PSR - 50.4%

(We don't give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.)

My takeaway:

Unless a calamity occurs and doesn't resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I'm keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won't kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don't shit my pants and keep buying that is..

Future research:

Experiment with spreads, calendar spreads, diagonal spreads, active stock picking. Fine tuning deltas. Timing the purchases with low IV. Hedging with VIX, gold, bonds, T-bills.."|investing|An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPs|35.0|0.71

&amp;#x200B;

Billionaire hedge fund manager [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.cnbc.com/paul-tudor-jones/) told CNBC on Monday he’s paying close attention to this week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting in light of recent economic data showing [higher consumer prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/cpi-may-2021.html).

“If they treat these numbers — which were material events, they were very material — if they treat them with nonchalance, I think it’s just a green light to bet heavily on every inflation trade,” Jones said on [“Squawk Box.”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)

“If they say, ‘We’re on path, things are good,’ then I would just go all in on the inflation trades. I’d probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold,” added Jones, who called the stock market crash in 1987 and is founder and chief investment officer of [Tudor Investment](https://www.tudor.com/default.aspx#section-About).

On the other hand, Jones predicted that markets would be unsettled if the Fed comes out with a different tone Wednesday.

“If they course correct, if they say, ‘We’ve got incoming data, we’ve accomplished our mission or we’re on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,’ then you’re going to get a taper tantrum,” Jones said. “You’re going to get a sell-off in fixed income. You’re going to get a correction in stocks. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s over.”

The Fed’s two-day policy meeting is [scheduled to conclude Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/markets-await-the-feds-meeting-in-the-week-ahead.html), and Chairman Jerome Powell is set to hold a news conference after the central bank releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET.

Powell and company have maintained their highly accommodative monetary policy approach, which was instituted in response to [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). Central bankers have been steadfast [despite criticism](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html) that massive bond buying and near-zero interest rates are no longer necessary because the economic recovery is well underway and inflation data is concerning. 

Powell and other Fed officials say they believe rising prices are likely temporary as the economy reopens from all manner of pandemic-related disruptions, which in turn justifies their policy stance.

“The idea that inflation is transitory, to me ... that one just doesn’t work the way I see the world,” said Jones, who added he feels the central bank’s inflation views [put its credibility at risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-the-feds-credibility-is-at-risk-with-inflation-view.html).

In Monday’s “Squawk Box” interview, Jones also reiterated his [favorable outlook on bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-likes-bitcoin-calls-it-a-great-portfolio-diversifier-to-protect-his-wealth-over-time.html), calling it a “portfolio diversifier” and a ” story of wealth.” The longtime trader added that[ he’s grown nervous](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-says-a-stock-market-valuation-making-him-nervous.html) when considering the stock market’s valuation compared with the overall economy.

“The only thing I know for certain, I want 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities. At this point in time, I don’t know what I want to do with the other 80% until I see what the Fed is going to do,” Jones said."|investing|Paul Tudor Jones says ‘go all in on the inflation trades’ if Fed keeps ignoring higher prices|99.0|0.91

**Conclusion**

	Intel is among the stocks that are benefitting from the semiconductor shortage. CEO Pat Gelsinger expects the shortage to take a few years to recover. One problem the semiconductor industry faces is that the majority of chips are produced in Asia. Although recently, there has been a strong demand to increase chip production in the USA. Joe Biden's infrastructure plan includes $50B worth of subsidies for the semiconductor industry to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

* Grab doesn’t seem to have the ability to raise prices since it’s operating in sectors where its customers/drivers or merchant partners are sensitive to price increases/commission hikes
* Since Grab’s pricing power is questionable, I’m unsure how it will become profitable
* The company hasn’t been producing cash flows over the past few years, and that’s not impressive since it’s still loss-making
* Compared to its listed peers like Uber and DoorDash, Grab looks expensive in terms of its valuation

M051675 …. NPV …950 @ 0.00

\- Core CPI (excluding energy and food) rose 0.7% in May after increasing 0.9% in April

1623531830.0|0.0|t3_nygiwr|446.0|"I have been analyzing EA share price and have come to the conclusion that the stock is over valued.

The obvious indicator is as follows:

The P/E ratio is &gt;50 this is high especially compared to other video game publishers, most notably Activision, which is the publisher that owns the call of duty franchise with a p/e of &lt;40

My explanation for why the stock is over valued:

EA’s value comes from the future growth expected by the company. This future growth is expected from 2 main factors, licensing deals with Pro sports leagues (NFL) and Disney + Star Wars

I do not think these factors will greatly contribute to EA into the future.

The reason I think this is because EA has been in possession of these exclusive licensing deals for years and even decades. EA has had exclusivity of pro league licensed sports games for as long as most of us have been around, and it’s Star Wars deal has been old news for about half a decade and to make matters worse EA has lost its exclusive deal for Star Wars to Ubisoft (another video game publisher).

These deals are not likely to ale EA more valuable and it is much more likely that EA looses these deals then for EA to actually start making sufficient growth in its revenue or any other area of the company for that matter.

I’d really appreciate anyone else’s thoughts on my evaluation, it’s my first time making a DD post of this depth

Following on from Part 1, which was a brief introduction to the RSF Method for valuing seed and early-stage start-up companies, here we will start to dive into the underlying risk factors in the RSF Framework and try to identify examples of Lower Risk or Higher Risk traits.

Please comment your thoughts on the below. A note before diving in that no start-up will have all Lower Risk or all Higher Risk traits - each will bring its own idiosyncracies. Higher Risk traits do not necessarily correlate with a bad business/idea, just as Lower Risk traits do not signify that a business will be a success.

## Addressing Feedback

I will briefly address feedback to Part 1, but please skip to Management Risk if this is not of interest. Comments mostly focused on what the model is suitable for rather than how it worked.

In summary, this overview is written from the perspective of a retail investor looking to invest in early-stage companies without the networks, access to founders, and sourcing tools of an institutional VC or angel investor. Therefore, I will make reference to the RSF as a “Framework” to aid thinking rather than a valuation methodology. Typically, retail investors without significant capital would invest through crowdsourcing platforms and have zero say in the valuation of the start-up and may not have the chance to meet a founder face-to-face and delve into a company’s IP. As a result, retail investors may use the RSF framework primarily to consider the overall riskiness of a company, rather than a target valuation, though an insight into valuation would still be provided and help inform the final investment decision. However, it’s still useful to understand how the method was intended to work, which is what I covered in Part 1.

**Suitability for evaluating public / post-revenue companies:** this method would not be suitable for valuing more mature companies, both in public and private markets, as many other data points (e.g. earnings) can be used for valuing late-stage or mature companies. However, some of the risks described by the RSF are universal for all companies and so this post may still be helpful to engage with.

**A non-institutional approach:** it was suggested that the way different VC’s value start-ups is subjective, and also that the RSF Valuation Method is less likely to be used by institutional venture capitalists and seed investors. I do not disagree with these points, but will respond that professional investors have the ability to interview founders and gain private access to the company’s IP, which is often not available to retail investors. Retail investors without significant capital will typically invest through crowdsourcing platforms (e.g. StartEngine, Wefunder, Seedrs, Crowdcube) and have less information to make a decision on. Retail investors using these platforms also have to deal with a pre-determined valuation and I hypothesise that most companies would therefore be “overvalued”, as the power to set terms (i.e. how much equity to give away and at what price) rests strongly with the company and not the retail investors. Therefore, retail investors cannot use the same approach as institutional VCs and angel investors and a framework for properly evaluating investment opportunities is critical.

**“I am skeptical of any founder and management of start-ups that cannot raise smart money through angel and VC funds.”** This is a great argument in support of developing a robust evaluation method. Although some founders turn to crowdsourcing for honest reasons, I am sure many do so to avoid more stringent due diligence (especially regarding financials) that they would face from an institutional VC. We should be aware that investing in start-ups is high risk, that retail investors likely face more selection risk than institutional VCs due to lack of data/transparency (which is true of most asset classes), and that retail investors need to be careful in allocating capital to start-ups. Target companies should be high conviction, and the resulting portfolio should be well diversified with many small bets. An allocation to seed-stage businesses should also be appropriately sized within a well diversified total portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

## 1. Management Risk

*What is the risk imposed by the current business management team?*

Venture Capitalists constantly throw around fun words to describe what they look for in a founding team. Courage... Determination... Grit... Chutzpah... Spunk? Management Risk is often considered the most important risk of those considered in the RSF Valuation Method and thus should be carefully considered.  Through my reading, I've suggested some ideas of what would lower management risk, and what might increase it.

**Lower Risk**

* Founders with *Courage* (not giving up in the face of adversity; determined to succeed; can learn from mistakes) and *Genius* (groundbreaking ideas; a visionary way of thinking). Other important traits: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, ambition, and entrepreneurialism.
* Relevant backgrounds and expertise, including diversity of experience and thought.
* Management with experience founding and successfully exiting start-ups, especially in the target sector/industry.
* Strong alignment, i.e. working on the business full-time.
* Access to strong advisors.
* Willing to partner with investors.

**Higher Risk**

* Founders who are short-sighted, sweat the small stuff excessively, are hot-headed / of ill-temperament, and opposites of the lower risk traits.
* Co-founders or other leaders leaving in the early stages of the company’s life (caveat: there may be situations where this is healthy for the business, e.g. if causing friction within management).
* Lack of relevant experience.
* New to the start-up environment.
* Team still to be built out.
* Unclear responsibilities.
* Lack of alignment, i.e. splitting focus by working on other business projects.

This is an easier risk factor to understand. While it can be harder as an individual investor to gain insight into management without meeting the founders and/or management team, taking advantage of webinars or fundraise pitch calls to see the leadership in action and using sources like LinkedIn to evaluate prior experience can be invaluable.

&amp;#x200B;

## 2. Stage of the Business

*How mature is the business and what is the inherent risk of failure?*

It is an unspoken understanding that a lot of start-ups fail. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp) covers the reasons why quite well, with the statistic that U.S. start-up [failure rates in 2019](https://www.national.biz/2019-small-business-failure-rate-startup-statistics-industry/) were around 90%. 2020 saw the same 90% rate, and this and a lot of other cool statistics were reported by [Review42](https://review42.com/resources/what-percentage-of-startups-fail/) in Feb 2021.

We accept that the nature of start-ups brings an inherently high failure rate. So how do we apply a score from +2 to -2? There are a couple of ideas below, but Redditors should chip in with further examples here, or suggest whether these traits belong under other factors:

**Lower Risk**

* Prototype developed, tested, and proven to work.
* Market validation, i.e. first customers acquired and sales made.
* Employee headcount growing.
* Strategic relationships developed, e.g. joint ventures, marketing alliances, licensing arrangements, selling/distribution, etc.

**Higher Risk**

* Prototype not developed, i.e. still in the concept phase.
* No demonstration of product-market fit.
* Low headcount beyond founders, or limited growth.

While it is easy to tar every start-up with a thick brush labeled ""-2"", we should remember that start-ups must be judged relative to one another and to their industry. Therefore, we should be conscious of how companies may be marked up, as well as down.

&amp;#x200B;

## 3. Legislation / Political Risk

*Will politics or regulation hamper business growth?*

This can be difficult to judge and I welcome other's views on this. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/politicalrisk.asp) again offers a good overview as to the inherent difficulties in quantifying this risk factor:

&gt;Political risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as ""geopolitical risk,"" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of [jurisdiction risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jurisdiction-risk.asp).  
&gt;  
&gt;Political risks are notoriously hard to quantify because there are limited sample sizes or case studies when discussing an individual nation. Some political risks can be insured against through international agencies or other government bodies. The outcome of political risk could drag down investment returns or even go so far as to remove the ability to withdraw capital from an investment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lower Risk**

* Governments aligned with the objectives of the business (e.g. the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact).
* Operating in countries with stable political processes and leadership.
* Government unlikely to interfere with the business or its management team, including in the case of M&amp;A activity.

**Higher Risk**

* Government (positioned to start) implementing legislation making business operations more challenging.
* Operating in countries with volatile legislative and political frameworks
* Government can interfere with business operations.

An example of government being well aligned with business objectives is the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact, especially in Europe and increasingly in the US, which provides incentives for or decreases the legislative risk to green-focused start-ups. An example of a government interfering with business can be seen in the recent [China-Ant Group / Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Group#Backlash_from_regulators) situation which resulted in a highly anticipated $34 billion IPO being halted. I would love to hear more risks and examples for this section, and whether you think I’m hitting the right areas, as it is a more difficult factor to quantify.

Regarding disruptive technology, which is often seen in early-stage companies, it may be the case that a start-up is among the first in the birth of a new industry. In time, this may lead to new and novel regulation. An example is how politicians and central banks are increasingly taking note of blockchain technology and related cryptocurrencies. If disrupted sectors are important to the government or other agents (e.g. the financial industry and national currencies), regulation may be applied harder/more tightly and previously innovative companies may be stifled. Conversely, a new industry showing great opportunity for society may be encouraged to grow.

Which leads me to something to bear in mind: not all regulation is bad, and not all de-regulation is good. Kate Raworth makes an excellent point in her book Doughnut Economics on how de-regulation is really just ""re-regulation"" anyway. An example once given during a panel on Machine Learning &amp; AI at the Royal Society highlighted that it was only once regulation regarding privacy and restricting the use of cameras on drones in [Sweden](https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-in-sweden/) did drone innovation really take off in the country. The rules must be known before the game can be properly played. I offer this only as a counter-example to the commonly held belief that de-regulation or an unregulated environment is always the best environment for a business to operate in.

&amp;#x200B;

## 4. Manufacturing Risk or Service Delivery Risk

*Could the business fail to produce products or deliver a service?*

A brilliant management team and an excellent market environment mean nothing if the supply chain or ability to provide a service is unavailable. In 2020, UK-EU relations made headlines as the ability for the UK and Europe to share supply chains to produce COVID-19 vaccines fell to implicit and explicit threats on each side that access to raw materials could be shut off if vaccines were not shared equitably. There are elements of Political and International risk in this scenario, but the point is that if a company does not have the raw materials required to produce its good, or the channels available through which to deliver its service, then it is going to have a hard time producing any revenues.

Manufacturing risk can cover not just the ability to consistently obtain necessary raw materials at an attractive and stable price point but also maintaining the necessary equipment and the relevant expertise within a company to produce an end-product of suitable quality from those materials.

Service Delivery Risk I believe has two angles. One is services the business owner requires to run their business. The other is the ability to provide a service to their customers. For the first, an example would be [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), and is the risk that one party will not make good on its end of the agreement. This is more likely to be a problem in times of financial stress as various measures are often put in place to mitigate this risk in more normal economic times. For the second, this is typically people-driven and can include having the right expertise available and the ability to place that expertise in the required location to deliver the service. Quality and upkeep of systems is also important.

**Lower Risk**

* Manufacturing:
   * Simple, easily trainable, or automated process to produce the good.
   * Ubiquitous and cheap raw materials.
   * Stable, short supply chains.
* Services:
   * Dealing with well-established and trustworthy counterparties
   * Suitable, readily available expertise
   * Robust systems
   * Flexibility of roll-out

**Higher Risk**

* Manufacturing:
   * Skilled work required to produce the end-good. Few available trained individuals, and/or high turnover of trained individuals.
   * Volatile pricing of raw materials.
   * Complex supply chains, potentially with less-reputable counterparties.
* Services:
   * Underdeveloped marketplace of counterparties
   * Lack of skilled individuals
   * Complex, inflexible systems

This is a factor I am less confident on – feedback and further thoughts welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

## 5. Sales &amp; Marketing Risk, or ""Go to Market"" Risk

*What is the risk of sales and marketing problems?*

Sales and Marketing are key to a successful business. No sales = no revenue. No marketing = potentially limited sales and growth. These terms are often wrapped up in a “go-to-market strategy”, which encompasses the step-by-step plan a business follows to successfully launch a product into the market. This is summarised nicely in four steps by [Vendasta](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/go-to-market-strategy/) and includes researching target markets, product viability, and product demand, planning the product development roadmap, creating a marketing and pricing strategy, and delivering a positive customer experience. The number of elements at play here can make it difficult for us to distill the key risk factors.

For Sales Risk, I quote from [Analyst Prep](https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/corporate-finance/leverage-business-risk-sales-risk-operating-risk-financial-risk/) with regards to the CFA 2019 Level I Exam curriculum:

&gt;The uncertainty associated with the price and quantity of goods and services is referred to as sales risk. It is affected by demand for a company’s product as well as the price per unit of the product.

Sales risk can be associated with certain parts of the sales plan (e.g. regional / international sales) or the whole pipeline. Risks may take the form of poor leads, low customer awareness, high customer churn, shifting customer needs, lack of marketing expertise/people within the business, limited sales channels, better competitors, or negative economic conditions (e.g. recession). Additionally, a business may become dependent on a small number of products, geographies, or clients for revenue (concentration risk) and find it difficult to expand further.

Marketing Risk is the risk that marketing is unsuccessful and ultimately incurs losses. Marketing includes advertising, events branding, partnering with businesses, and other brand-building activity. Inherent in marketing is market research and the need for a business to know its customers. Successful marketing will result in further sales. Unsuccessful marketing will fail to add to or will reduce sales. Failure could entail a lack of demand materialization, but also damage to the company’s brand.

I believe that [Financial Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062415/what-are-major-categories-financial-risk-company.asp), or the risk that the business will be unable to generate suitable revenues, cut costs, or finance itself to breakeven, would also be considered under this factor.

**Lower Risk**

* Management has established links in the market.
* Large, growing, and accessible addressable market.
* Strong brand identity / has demonstrated successful marketing.
* Cheap marketing options.
* Customers are (likely to be) sticky.
* Product is not culturally sensitive (can translate to new markets with ease).
* Costs are controllable (high margin product).

**Higher Risk**

* Me-too brands exist.
* Lack of sales experience in the team.
* Cannot demonstrate knowledge of customers.
* Small addressable and/or difficult to access market.
* High customer churn / low customer loyalty.

The Risk Factor Summation Method does not apply a weighting to different factors, and would quickly become very complex if it did. However, the way I interpret this factors means there are many crucial elements that should be carefully considered. Let me know if you think any of these elements should be considered under different factors, or conversely if you think any more should be included here. Note that I have tried to steer clear of competitive edge as that will come in a later factor.

&amp;#x200B;

## Looking Ahead

That concludes the second part of the RSF Method overview. Again, I look forward to constructive discussion and criticism. We will kick off part 3 with the next risk factor, Funding / Capital Raising Risk."|investing|Let's Discuss: the Risk Factor Summation Valuation Method, Pt 2|8.0|0.69
1623518633.0|0.0|t3_nybp86|447.0|"BeachBody is going public combined with MYX Fitness (PTON competitor) and OpenFit, under ticker symbol $BODY (currently F R X). Shaq, Lebron, and Arnold are all shareholders. Sounds meme-y, I know. The financials are solid here.

**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries in the future. Growth company imo. Connected at home fitness will disrupt the gym industry, again imo.

**PTON Comparison**

A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer. I'm thinking about this like a caveman in that I believe people who want to be involved in this type of fitness will first look for the cheapest option. I mean who gets more foot traffic, Walmart or Whole Foods? I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. I will say PTON has a cult following, and the affluent type will probably not settle for less. Here are some price comparisons of starting prices among connected fitness bikes.

NordicTrak - $2k

Proform - $1.5k

SoulCycle - $2.5k

Peloton - $1.8k

MYX - $1.3k

**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**

Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic—and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).

**Tech in Fitness**

Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.

**2021 Q1 Financials**

Total Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY

Total Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)

(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)

**Future Plans &amp; News**

Here’s where they’re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they’ll have what they referred to as a “war chest” of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&amp;A, marketing, and expansion.

**International Expansion**

The team has recently stated plans of expanding to 10 countries in the near future.

**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD’s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here. ](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)

**OpenFit PartnerShips**

OpenFit (backed by Lebron &amp; Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here. ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)

OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness, giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)

**Meme Potential**

Hate me or love me for this aspect

* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Or something like that.
* Comparison to PTON
* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company.
* [Here ](https://vimeo.com/561655635)is a message from Shaq to shareholders, hilariously scripted but hey it’s Shaq
* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO

I assume that once the merger is complete, these three will be able to participate in PR and marketing for the company. The team has stated that there are certain SEC rules against this until the transaction is complete.

**Bear Case - MLM**

BeachBody has been accused of being a Multi-Level Marketing Scheme. While it is true that BB coaches are incentivized to bring on other coaches and sell Shakeology, it is not mandatory. In fact, employees and coaches are not allowed to have products on hand (shakeology) which is typical of a true MLM. Because of this, it’s a non-issue to me. I don’t find this company to be unethical, as they have truly helped people to change their lives in a positive way. Plus, I’m a believer in personal responsibility. As stated previously, coaches CANNOT have product on hand, and become coaches on their own free will. You can become a coach and never sell a single product or bring on another coach. No gun-to-the-head style sales tactics. If anything, it’s more closely related to affiliate marketing.

Have some of the coaches used unethical tactics to make sales? I'm sure they have. Happens in business. They've also helped millions of people get into shape and be more healthy. By utilitarian ethic standards, I believe they are ethical. You should do your own research and come up with your own conclusion.

**Final Thoughts**

All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities.

**TLDR;** Cheapest bike, home workouts here to stay, tech good, Shaq, meme

Hello everyone, 

A friend of mine has asked me for my opinion on investing money. 

I said to invest in a low TER global etf. Meaning Devloped+Emerging markets and large - small cap. 

Now my question, he is an eco guy so I am searching for an esg fund. 

Any suggestions? 

I found the vanguard global all cap esg etf. 

It includes all the caps and all the Markets. Also there’s would be no need for rebalancing due to it being only one fund. 

Do you think that one alone is diversified enough? 

In my optimism it looks like a good investment vehicle for a long time, even though I am not sure how strict the esg criteria really is, can anybody shed a light on this maybe? 

I am even thinking for myself to swap my investments to that funds. 0.20% TER all cap global just looks so juicy because you don’t have to do anything but safe money and throw it in there. 

Am I missing anything? Is there something else that is important?

&gt;Holding  stock in a street name is an accepted practice, but you shouldn't keep a  huge portion of your net worth in a brokerage account using this  method, especially if your account value exceeds the SIPC insurance  limits.

I am not convinced that this text is not misleading.

I hypothesize that there are no significant risks associated with holding shares in a street name instead of holding them directly because the beneficial owner of the shares (the customers of the stockbroker) is a creditor with secured debt. **What could go wrong** that may lead to the shares go missing or something? I can't imagine such a case.

The article is US-centric (because it mentions SPIC).

**What are the risks of holding shares in a street name in US and other countries?**

In some cases (when holding shares in a street name) the wrong withholding tax rate on dividends can be applied (I know about online stock brokers that apply 30% tax rate instead of the lower rate i.e. 10% or 15% for US dividends according to the double taxation treaty.)

In other cases (when holding shares in a street name) a correct withholding tax rate on dividends is applied.

Therefore holding shares in a street name has nothing to do with the applying of the correct withholding tax rate on dividends.

I am giving examples with the taxation as an argument that holding the shares in a street name has nothing to do with the correct withholding of the tax on dividends.

So I am looking for other disadvantages of holding shares in a street name instead in my own name.

If in Russia 0.6% inflation is nothing at all, then in the USA it is a serious target excess. It should be noted that the low base effect had a greater impact. A global coronavirus outbreak began in March last year and prices fell. However, given that most of the acceleration occurred at the beginning of this year, it can be stated that inflationary pressures are already there today.  


So, gold rose 0.7%. This may seem logical, because gold is a perceived inflation hedge. In a longer-term perspective, it is. Food, clothing... it costs (in gold) +/- the same as it did 100 years ago. But if you think short-term, then the gold pricing is not so simple.

([https://sun9-60.userapi.com/impg/N9Quvez3rhDcB1JhnklE3lDpzKoOfhKUjA-hYA/GhFaWOePy28.jpg?size=1200x675&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=0c17f0fcdb9a701618f09caedec2c5b0&amp;type=album](https://sun9-60.userapi.com/impg/N9Quvez3rhDcB1JhnklE3lDpzKoOfhKUjA-hYA/GhFaWOePy28.jpg?size=1200x675&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=0c17f0fcdb9a701618f09caedec2c5b0&amp;type=album)) The graph illustrates a strong inverse correlation between gold and 10-year Treasury yield. What is real profit? It's the profit of a company or investment after adjusting for inflation. It is calculated simply by subtracting the inflation rate from the gross profit margin. So what does that mean for us?  


As long as the market believes that the inflation jump is temporary, the nominal yield of long bonds will not rise. Investors will not sell them. This is very good for gold. Inflation is rising, but nominal yields are not. Real profit is falling. But if the market believes that the inflation jump is not temporary? Bonds will be dumped, nominal yields will rise faster than inflation itself, and gold will fall.  


In general, if the market underestimates inflation (does not sell bonds), then it is good if gold is a part of your investment portfolio, if, on the contrary, it overestimates (resells long bonds), then it is better not to have gold.  


Why is there such a correlation between bond yield and gold price dynamics at all? It's simple. Gold is a perpetual zero coupon bond. What do you think?"|investing|What makes the price of gold go up? Inflation?|22.0|0.79

its basically doing the same thing now, but indicating that the SPY might close bearish for the month of June

Historically, if SPY closes bearish, the following month sees on average a 20 point drop from previous Months High point, in this case our current month June

For example if the high for June was $420, then expect, at minimum for July to hit $400 at some point in the month

again this is ONLY if June closes bearish

the worry here also is that inflation keeps rising and the Rep keeps rising and currently sits at $500 Billion

The insane part is looking at movement correlated with the SPY it seems the most likely play here would, obviously be, SPY Puts, Cash and Longs on GME and really any ticker than sees growth while the S&amp;P500 drops

i know this is all astrological for you guys here at investing but this wouldnt be the first time my indicator has predicted something like this

again, forecasted the drop of BTC, and also the drop of Covid last year and exactly where to re enter + a lot of gold movement and other things that i wont get into

but yeah, discussion? if june does close bearish i a like 99% sure that July sees a 20 point drop from Junes highest point and i will be buying puts the last day of June

BUT

what catalyst could cause this to go lower?

would inflation be a big play here?

would GME running hard trigger this?

But I've been watching the news and I've seen that the prices of houses are increasing, as companies are bidding higher, which forces people to rent. And the cost of living is increasing in general. So I've just played with some scenarios that might be as a result of this increasing cost:

If cost of housing and living is increasing, maybe less people would buy cars. If less people buy cars more people would use public transportation. This could trickle down to more people buying and using bicycles and then I remembered that the biden administration (Pete Buttigeg etc) were also recommending people to use bicycles more.

For starters, even a non-leveraged fund that falls 10% in one day can't make it back up with a simple 10% increase the following day. A $100 share that falls 10% in one day is worth $90 at the end of the day. But if its price goes up 10% on the second day, that’s a 10% increase from $90, putting the price at $99. There’s an erosion that occurs with a daily reset, and when a fund is leveraged, that erosion is magnified.”

But came across this alternative perspective:

A particular portfolio of 40 percent TQQQ, 20 percent TMF, 40 percent TLT with monthly rebalancing proposed by us in the 2017 paper as a leveraged ETF alternative to classical stocks/bonds portfolios performed well in 2018 and through the Coronavirus crisis up to January 15, 2021. 

New to bond investments and would love to hear any thoughts. It would seem this strategy worked because the Fed intervened but what about when interest rates eventually rise?

Per another post: “If you have an equity heavy portfolio (like most people) TLT is probably the best bond fund for diversification during a stock market crisis. But don't think of it as low risk. It's just a different risk from your equity allocation and one that hopefully offsets the equity risk during a crisis. If you want safety and low absolute risk level look at shorter duration bond funds.”

&amp;#x200B;

I asked this question in another subreddit and I havent have an asnwer yet, and really I would like someone more intelligent than me to see if they can find the catch before I try to close this contract and get stuck with some stocks that I dont want.

Im looking to buy an option which the price of the stock is around 9 dollars, but then I saw they have a Put option of 15 dollars with a price of 55 cents. basically, that put the option in the money with around 40% benefit. But this must be a mistake, or it might have a catch to it. The option is only in sell and there is not buyers to it, so I would have to exercise the put option, which of course I dont mind and will sell it right away. But am I missing something? I just cant find the trap on it.

PD. I just found another put option in 60 dollars! weird thing is I can find it in the cell phone app but not in the website.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

I bought the contract since it was only 55 dollars I assume it would be a good reward if I was able to execute and not a big lose if it was something weird. I called the bank to ask about executing the contract and before buying the stock for the closing and they told me they need do some investigation before closing in it because it seems that the contract offering is old and with pricing before the split (as the company was divided) so, they are doing some digging to see if they can execute the contract; which I think they wont be able to.

The foundations of our present understanding of financial markets lie in the classic theories of portfolio choice (Markowitz 1952) and market general equilibrium (Treynor 1999; Lintner 1965; Sharpe 1964). A basic insight from these theories is that an asset’s price can be decomposed into two factors: (1) an idiosyncratic factor specific to the asset and (2) a systematic factor common to all assets in the market. In a mean–variance world, this insight implies that the optimal portfolio choice for all market participants should be some combination of a risk-free asset and a well-diversified market portfolio. A straightforward explanation for the introduction of—and subsequent explosion in demand for—index products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is the need for such well-diversified portfolios. As happens often in economics, such an explanation, while broadly true, glosses over many finer details of the story—and the devil, as always, is in the details.

Do ETFs affect systemic risks in financial markets, and if they do, via what mechanism? How robust are our markets to the risks, and what can we do to keep the risks under control? Are certain markets more prone than others to such risks? In this paper, we dig deeper into ETFs to examine such questions. One could go about this task in multiple ways—from citing empirical evidence in markets to analyzing mathematical models of ETF trading. We choose a middle ground here, favoring explanations well-grounded in economic theory that can nevertheless be examined in light of existing empirical evidence #

The core issue with ETFs is best explained using an analogy. When the first Standard &amp; Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) ETF was launched in 1993, index products were envisioned as passengers in a car driven by underlying markets. Because of a multitude of factors, the roles have now reversed in many markets, with ETFs in the driver’s seat and underlying markets relegated to the status of mere passengers.

ETFs were admitted into the car as passengers, which means they never had to pass a rigorous driving test. In other words, we do not know how well they drive. Further, given that they now occupy the driver’s seat in many markets as a fait accompli, asking them to stop and take a proper test risks bringing the car to a complete halt. Under such conditions, how do regulators decide which ETFs really know how to drive, and how do we deal with the ones that seem to be dodgy drivers?

An index product such as an ETF, by its very nature, emphasizes the systematic factor over idiosyncratic factors. This is because, in a basket, the idiosyncratic factors cancel each other out, leaving the systematic factor as the central determinant of price. When index products become the chief driver of markets, the systematic factor becomes the key mover of not just index prices but also all underlying asset prices. This is a problem because an asset’s price is then less reflective of the specifics in that asset market. Furthermore, as the distinctiveness of assets gets lost, traders can more easily engage in speculative herding strategies. Herding behavior is what turns potential weaknesses into systemic risks, allowing problems in one market to easily spill over into other markets."|investing|Do ETFs pose systematic risk?

They're also telling me to expect an average of 9% annual gains over the course of a 30 year investment lifetime. My question is for those with a bit of experience with both (I know more people will have SP500 experience than true professionally managed MPT), but is it worth a 1% annual fee to go for 9% when that's roughly the average annual return of the SP500 anyway? I know the primary benefit, as I understand it, of the MPT isn't necessarily the actual gains, but the standard deviation over time in relation to those gains. If you can take 9% with less volatility than the same return with more volatility, it's better...  but I'm just curious how this has actually played out for folks.

Accurately tracking member activity is critical to the increasing trend  of using wellness activities to reduce healthcare costs. Openfit and  Concierge Health’s unique partnership broadens access to these benefits,  allowing members to engage in a wide variety of fitness classes offered  by Openfit, track their workout anywhere and at any time and ultimately  receive credit for that activity. As credit was previously allocated  based on visits to brick and mortar gyms, this partnership seeks to more  deeply embed health and wellness activities in members’ lives with  convenient and accessible experiences. 

“Our partnership with Concierge Health will allow Openfit to expand its  goals of making health and wellness accessible to everyone - not just  those who work out at a gym - while seamlessly integrating fitness  activities with incentives and rewards,” said Jon Congdon, Openfit’s  CEO. “We support Concierge Health’s mission of reducing health care  costs by providing a holistic digital wellness solution that is simple,  affordable, and effective, and includes a wide variety of best in class  fitness options.” 

A survey conducted by Wakefield Research revealed that 87% of  respondents who already did or will feel comfortable working out in a  gym said that they would continue pumping and burning from their living  rooms and 85% of respondents agreed that at home fitness provides  convenience and accessibility benefits. This partnership underscores the  expected continued growth of the at home fitness market, which is  estimated will reach $59 billion by 2027. 

“The introduction of Openfit to the Concierge Health Network will  provide in-demand content and expand member opportunities for engagement  and rewards,” said Matthew Schober, Chief Development Officer of  Concierge Health. “With our shared missions and values, I am confident  that our collaboration with Openfit will create innovative opportunities  for both platforms and better health outcomes for our members.” 

Openfit is available on Openfit.com, iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, Fire  TV and Samsung TV (through Samsung Health) devices, in addition to Apple  Watch support.

The company amended its annual report to include the going-concern notice, which can flag survival problems for businesses within the next 12 months. The warning comes as new challenges emerge for the two-year-old firm that is trying to convert a former General Motors Co. plant in Ohio to produce electric pickup trucks. It has said its first model, the Endurance, will start production in September.

Lordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns said on a call with analysts in late May that the startup would need to raise more capital to hit its target of building 2,200 pickup trucks by year-end. The company said at the time that higher-than-expected costs were accelerating its cash burn and that it would finish the year with between $50 million and $75 million on hand.

The company was among a number of new electric-vehicle startups that went public last year through reverse mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Lordstown raised $675 million from its reverse merger last fall, a deal that valued the aspiring truck maker at about $1.6 billion.

The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

However in reading about and listening to comments regarding the growth in the number of retail traders and what seems like a movement towards trading options something else struck me.

**Could the price of call options  also rise due to an increase in demand (i.e. more traders are asking for them) for options?**  

It seems this is similar to a situation where an ETF's share price becomes greater than the NAV price.  I know there are mechanisms in place to address that when it occurs.

“U.S. equity futures turned lower Tuesday following reports of widespread outages of major global news websites, including the New York Times and Bloomberg, as well as the main internet portal of the British government.

The gov.uk website reported a '503 Service Unavailable' error message around 6:20 am Eastern time, alongside similar connection failures from sites such as The New York Times, CNN, the London Guardian, Bloomberg and the Financial Times. TheStreet was also affected by the outage, as was the main TV2 broadcaster in Denmark.

The outage follows a series of cyber attacks on U.S. companies and European agencies, including Ireland's state-controlled healthcare system, over the past few weeks. In fact, only yesterday, U.S. authorities said they had seized more than $2.3 million in ransom payments, made via Bitcoin, linked to last month's cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline by the Russia-based network known as DarkSide.

Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has previously indicated a modest opening bell gain, slumped 60 points following news of the disruptions, while those linked to the S&amp;P 500 reversed a 5 point gain to indicate an opening bell decline of 0.5 points.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields also eased to 1.554% while the dollar index held its gains to trade at 90.097.

OP Note: As somebody whose largest single name holding is Cloudflare I woke up to these alerts about a service provider outage and was praying it wouldn’t be Cloudflare.

While Poshmarck, Depop and all the others have gotten a head start by capitalizing in the growing second hand retail demand by Gen Z, as time goes by this customers will migrate to ThredUP in order to fulfill their needs.

You see, as this generation goes to collage or starts getting jobs, they will no longer have the time (or it won't be worth it for them) to make listings, deal with buyers,  packaging, labelling, shipping, deal with returns, etc... only to make $50-60. Consignment sales will dominate this industry and ThredUP is the only player capable of meeting those demands, owning distribution centers and being vertically integrated.

ThredUP been a success as it has been able to find the perfect value between time and money. Their core base has been wealthy/middle class families that don't want to deal with the process of directly selling their clothes (not worth it) but still want to make a positive change in the environment while monetizing their clothes. Even with 72% gross margins and multiple facilities, they still can meet all the supply customers are trying to sell to them.

It's even better when a large part of those sellers get paid and leave the money in the platform to use that cash for purchasing clothes on ThredUP, effectively making the company negative working capital.

The way I see it is whoever gets the supply will be able to meet the demand. What moat does Poshmarck or Depop has to retain their buyers and sellers? Why would someone decide to spend two weeks to sell 3-4 items only to make $60  when you made that in one day with your regular job?

 As the space get's crowded and prices go down, incentives for individual sellers will go down and ThredUp will be there to capitalize on it.

## Modeling Assset Prices

**Risk premium** is the compensation one receives for taking on additional risk, in the form of expected excess return compared to the risk-free rate of return.  The risk-free rate of return would be something like the yield of US treasury bills.  ELI5: If you invest in something dangerous, you want to be paid more.

When it comes to equities, there is a concept called the efficient market hypothesis, which states that asset prices reflect all available information.  The most effective way to verify this is to develop an asset pricing model which is sufficiently accurate based on given inputs.  You may have heard of **CAPM** (Capital Asset Pricing Model, Sharpe-1964 and Lintner-1965) – which is one of the first major accepted models whose main input is β.  You’ve probably heard of α and β, but essentially α is the ability to beat the market, and β is the volatility (specifically the sensitivity market conditions).  As an investor, your goal is generally to get as much α as possible, without taking on more risk than you can tolerate.

CAPM does a decent job of explaining **Market** risk premium as a function β – which is effectively the benefit you get from investing in stocks rather than bonds.  However, it was found to capture only about 70% of the excess return, so either the market isn’t efficient, or there were other undiscovered factors.  Enter the discovery of the **Value** and **Size** factors.  Researchers discovered that value stocks (ones that had high book value relative to price) and small cap stocks (ones that had smaller total valuation) tended to outperform the market in a way that wasn’t explained by CAPM.  So Fama and French (1992) developed a new **3-Factor Model** incorporating Market, Value, and Size premiums.  This now explained about 90% of asset pricing.

More recently (2015), Fama and French have since updated to a 5-Factor Model, which includes the **Profitability** and **Investment** factors that could explain about 95%  of asset pricing.  Profitability is rather self-explanatory, while Investment refers to conservative vs. aggressive asset growth (with conservative outperforming).  One interesting finding was that the Value premium could actually be omitted without hurting the model accuracy because the Value premium could be absorbed by the Profitability and Investment premiums.  So from here on, I’ll use a **4-Factor** model of: Market, Size, Profitability, Investment.

-----

## Quantifying Risk Premia

So why should you care, as an investor?  One major debate in investing is active vs. passive, with most evidence indicating that active management in aggregate fails to deliver excess return after accounting for fees.  This is why most people are recommended to simply use low cost, market-cap weighted index funds such as $VOO or $VT for the majority of their portfolio.  However, for more *risk-tolerant* investors, this may not be the best possible result.  If there are indeed ways to capture *independent risk* beyond the Market premium, then it is possible to increase expected return while still remaining passive and diversified.

Let’s look at data from the Ken French Data Library, over the period 1963-2020.  We examine the overall risk premiums generated by Market, Profitability, Investment, and Size factors.  We also examine the *probability of a positive risk premium existing over a 10-year period*.   The assumption here is that if you are risk-tolerant, you are probably younger and looking at long timescales.  The premiums can vary widely or be negative for individual years, so we are hoping to buy and hold, harvesting a positive premium over many years.  If you are middle-aged, you might be better off sticking to the basic market-cap weighted approach as it is lower risk.

Aggregating this data, let’s further account for geographical effects.  Since the premiums vary between different market regions, we’ll use a crude 60-20-20 respective weightings for USA, developed, and emerging markets.  Obviously this is not a perfect weighting but it’s good enough to illustrate the broader trend.  The resulting premium is measured in additional % annualized excess return compared to the risk-free return.  The result is as follows:

[4 Factor Risk Premiums, 1963-2020]( https://imgur.com/a/pXH7eOc)

This is a surprisingly intuitive result.  As the value of each factor premium increases, the reliability of that premium decreases.  This chart behaves as if the efficient market hypothesis is true, and provides a rough guideline for the cost of each premium.  If you only want a slight boost to expected return, you can increase weight in small cap stocks.  If you want a more sizeable boost with more risk of downside, you can increase weight in profitable stocks.

**Disclaimer:** at the end of the day, it is always dubious to predict future returns even based on long historical periods like this one.  You also need to be able to stomach long periods where the premium may not exist, such as the poor performance of value stocks this past decade.  However, for disciplined investors with a long horizon – capturing these factors has a good chance of generating real excess returns.

So, what to actually invest in?  These days, there are more and more ETFs out there that incorporate factor-based investing.  However, it’s difficult to get exposure to the right factors and across all market regions.  I’ve compiled a table of some options here:



* | Market | Profitability | Investment | Size | Multifactor
---|---|----|----|----|----
US | VTI, SCHB, ITOT | QLV, QUAL, FQAL |  | VB, IJR | LRGF, FLRG, VFMF, OMFL
Developed | VEA | QLVD, IQLT |  | SCZ | INTF, FDEV
Emerging | VWO | QLVE |  | EEMS | EMGF, FDEM
**Global** | **VT** |  |  |  | **ACWF**


There are quite a few gaps, if you know any options to fill those feel free to comment and I can edit them in.  There are also other non-fundamental factors such as Value and Momentum that have numerous options.  How to weight them is another issue beyond the scope of this post, and depends again on your risk tolerance.

Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.

In a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.

The analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.

“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”

As part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.

In the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.

The Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.

“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this
patience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”

Most on the Street see tame inflation
To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.

Most on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.

Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.

On price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.

“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.

That will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.

Congress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.

“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”

The Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.

Then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.

“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”

The firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs."|investing|Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation|387.0|0.92

The full table of returns: [https://imgur.com/gallery/uWdoVFd](https://imgur.com/gallery/uWdoVFd)

There's so much to this 75-page paper that it's honestly hard to generate a full hypothesis on what this means for the future, as much is concluded within the paper itself which I have only started reading myself. Regardless, I agree firmly with the final conclusions drawn in the blog post regarding the asset class returns. Specific takeaways well worth as a reminder if nothing else:

&gt;Short-term returns for the stock market can be highly unpredictable and unstable. Long-term returns for the stock market have been far more stable. While real returns have been elevated for the past 5 and 10 years, there isn’t much of a difference between returns over 15, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is comforting even if future returns are promised to no one.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s also a good reminder that the high returns in the current cycle won’t last forever. You can’t set your iPhone to it but eventually higher than average returns will be followed by lower than average returns...  
&gt;  
&gt;...While gross returns will likely be lower, net returns should be higher for those who are able to avoid behavioral mistakes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest threat to long-term returns is your behavior in the short-term

Page 43 goes into large-cap stocks moreso, stating in part...

&gt; ...Due to their size and power, the large growth stocks are attracting the glare of politicians and regulators across the globe. Pressure is building for a digital tax and/ or a break up to dilute their market share. In particular, a globally coordinated effort is under way, led by the OECD. It plans to reset the global corporate tax system such that companies will have to pay based on where they have activities, and minimum tax rates will apply. In effect, this will cut the incentive for companies to base their headquarters in low-tax jurisdictions. The US, however, is opposed to such a digital tax, which would have a big effect on US companies. With global tax forces pushing in one direction and the US opposing them, yet acting on competition concerns, the stage looks set for a reckoning for mega-cap growth stocks. Given their ubiquity throughout the fabric of life around the world, it seems likely that a sudden bout of disorder could shake not only companies and stock markets but also how we live our lives.

I also understand that the owner of the bond can redeem a bond too, which confuses me.

Is it that there is a set redemption value of a bond, i.e., $1200 for a bond that was initially priced at $1000, and the bond can be redeemed by the issuer if it's callable or if the owner agrees to redeem it (if not callable), or it can be redeemed by the owner if the owner deems it advantageous but in this case the issuer would also have to agree to redeem it. (does the issuer have to agree?)

Basically, if the redemption value of a bond is higher than the initial price was to purchase it, why wouldn't people just buy an endless amount of bonds and sell them at a markup?

\------------------------------------------------

Looking back I was wrong and forget an important detail. When accounting for rebalancing, the difference in returns is minimized. The more often you rebalance VOOBreakdown, the less returns you'll see. When you don't rebalance, I believe the larger allocation of tech stocks carry some of the returns later on, but the aim of VOOBreakdown is to beat VOO only using broken-down etfs for more diversity, but it seems that is redundant with no difference in returns.

According to Investopedia, ""An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.""

So an ETF is a basket of securities - therefore a simple explanation could be that the ETF price is just the average of all securities it tracks. 

So we know how a stocks price move up and down - It's a function of the supply and demand on that stock. How much someone is willing to pay for a share. The more people who want shares and are willing to pay ever increasing prices from the sellers will drive the price of the stock upward and vice versa.  

But there is more to it isn't there. Options play a very important role in the price fluctuations of a stock. If there are significant Puts and Calls against a stock then the Market Maker (MM) has to buy and sell shares to become Delta neutral. As this occurs, large purchases or sell offs can occur, which would push the stock price around. 

How does any of this work with ETFs?

As I stated at the top, an ETF is only an average of the sum of its parts therefor none of this price action is supposed to work right? SO I ask you all who are much smarter than me - How does an ETF's price work? Since supply &amp; demand still apply to an ETF. You can still watch ETFs on Level 2 and see the price rise and fall with the orders executed.

And since MMs still have to hedge options on ETFs, how does it affect the price of something that is only an average of something else? Furthermore, if an ETF's price can rise independently of the movement of the securities it tracks, can those movements effect the value of the individual stocks its made up from and if they can be manipulated by the ETF wouldn't that mean that the individual stock inside the ETF is more/less valuable than the stock outside the ETF, essentially giving an individual stock different values (value inside the ETF, value outside the ETF)?

Anyone else think Alibaba fundamental is crazy good for the depressed price?

Interactive brokers talks a good game: they promise 50% to give you of the interest collected, and they advertise very high borrowing rates. In my case, I was looking at RIDE: borrowing rate is currently 47%, but it was 80% when I decided to start my experiment.

I opened an IB account, and enabled SYE. I also enrolled in Fidelity's ""fully paid lending"" program. Fidelity consistently reports lower borrowing rates than IB, so I was expecting IB to be a better deal for me. Here's the outcome:

Fidelity currently gives me 17% interest on my RIDE shares. IB gives me only 10%. For some reason, IB collects only 20% interest (of which I get half), even though they list the borrowing rate as 47%. I'll be moving back to Fidelity.

EDIT: to clarify a little further, this only makes sense if you own highly shorted stocks that yield high interest rates. I own RIDE and UWMC, which to me look like low risk, high return investments courtesy of the shorts. I totally agree that shorts can keep them down for as long as they want, but  if I get 17%/year while they're doing it (plus any cap gains), I'm not going to complain.

While I hope that my post below is helpful and you maybe learn something, I'd love to get your feedback and ideas of how you think about each factor so we can create a more robust framework with which to use this approach. This post was getting quite long so I’ll post it in a few parts over the next few days.

## What is the Risk Factor Summation Method?

Originally developed by Ohio TechAngels, the RFS is a method used by venture capitalists and angel investors to value pre-revenue companies, typically in the pre-seed or pre-Series A stage of funding. It builds on approaches such as the [Venture Capital Valuation method](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/equity-valuation/venture-capital-valuation-method/) or the [Dave Berkus Valuation Method](https://berkonomics.com/?p=2752) by considering a broader range of risk factors that can affect start-ups as they grow into mature businesses.

Ohio TechAngels reportedly described the method as follows:

&gt;Reflecting the premise that the higher the number of risk factors, then the higher the overall risk, this method forces investors to think about the various types of risks which a particular venture must manage in order to achieve a lucrative exit. Of course, the largest is always ‘management risk’ which demands the most consideration and investors feel is the most overarching risk in any venture. While this method certainly considers the level of management risk it also prompts the user to assess other risk types” including: management, stage of the business, legislation/political risk, manufacturing risk, sales and marketing risk, funding/capital raising risk, competition risk, technology risk, litigation risk, international risk, reputation risk, potential lucrative exit.

&gt;!""Reportedly described"" as this is quoted all over the internet but I cannot find an original source.!&lt;

## How does the RFS Method Work?

**Step one**, an initial pre-money value for the company is determined through looking for 'market comparables', typically competitors in the same or similar industries. This shouldn't take into account specifics of the company per se but look for the average valuation for the industry and at the growth stage the company is operating in.

**Step two**, the method considers 12 risk factors, which we will cover in a moment. Each risk is assessed with regards to how it may impact the ability of the company to grow and execute a lucrative exit, and is assigned a score as follows:

* \+2 = Very Positive / Very Low Risk
* \+1 = Positive / Low Risk
* 0 = Neutral / Medium Risk
* \-1 = Negative / High Risk
* \-2 = Very Negative / Very High Risk

**Step three**, The average industry valuation derived in step one is adjusted up or down depending on the score for each risk factor. The adjustment amount can vary depending on what source you ask but typically shifts around $250k for each point move either way (e.g. +2 would add +$500k to the valuation; -1 would subtract $250k).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Thought 1: is a flat adjustment of $250k per point a suitable number? Should we consider otherwise for certain industries, or adjust this up or down based on the stage of the company (angel, seed, early) or the position of the market cycle?*

&amp;#x200B;

## So What Are the Factors?

I'm glad you asked. As mentioned, there are 12 and are presented in roughly the same order wherever you look. [Retiba](https://retiba.com/online-valuation/risk-factors-summation/)\* has offered some great summary sentences to get you started on what each risk means, which are included behind spoiler blocks in case you want to try and guess first - if you get 100% as a newcomer I will be suitably impressed.

\* don't expect to use the tool through that link without first surrendering your email address :-(

&amp;#x200B;

1. Management Risk - &gt;!Is it possible that the current business management team will impose a high risk on the business in the future?!&lt;
2. Stage of the Business - &gt;!Is the business at the initial stage of the maturity cycle that is inherently risky and likely to fail to a great extent?!&lt;
3. Legislation / Political Risk - &gt;!Can unfavourable regulation, legislation, and political conditions lead to business failure?!&lt;
4. Manufacturing Risk, or Service Delivery Risk - &gt;!Is it possible for the business to have trouble producing and failing altogether due to limited raw materials or an inability for counterparties to make good on agreements?!&lt;
5. Sales &amp; Marketing Risk, or ""Go to Market"" Risk - &gt;!How much your business may be affected by sales and marketing problems?!&lt;
6. Funding / Capital Raising Risk - &gt;!Given your awareness of the ecosystem, how likely is it that the business will have trouble raising capital in subsequent rounds?!&lt;
7. Competition Risk - &gt;!Given your awareness of the market, how intense do you assess the competitive environment the business will face?!&lt;
8. Technology Risk - &gt;!To what extent can the emergence of new technologies in the future jeopardize the existence of the business?!&lt;
9. Litigation Risk - &gt;!How likely is it that the business under evaluation goes through litigation crises and fails?!&lt;
10. International Risk - &gt;!To what extent can unfavourable international conditions and interactions with other countries put the business at risk?!&lt;
11. Reputation Risk - &gt;!To what extent can the business under evaluation be exposed to the crisis caused by brand reputation?!&lt;
12. Potential Lucrative Exit - &gt;!How likely it is for the potential lucrative of the business under evaluation to be in trouble in the future, and the company will not be able to make a good profit margin for its products and services?!&lt;

Several of these factors may be quite familiar (e.g. Management Risk, Stage of the Business), while others (e.g. Litigation Risk, International Risk) may be harder to fathom. [Seraf](https://seraf-investor.com/compass/article/approximations-assumptions-and-aspirations-methods-valuing-startups-part-ii) provide a [simple example](https://seraf-investor.com/sites/default/files/Risk%20Factor%20Method-3.jpg) of how positive and negatives for each factor can result in a valuation adjustment. While a helpful indicator, the examples here are limited. I've taken a stab at expanding on each factor and will share these in the next post.

Edit: As mentioned, feedback welcome, and do let me know if you have read any good sources on this method that I may have overlooked.

Edit 2: Addressing Feedback

I will briefly address feedback received on this. Comments mostly focused on what the model is suitable for rather than how it worked.

In summary, this overview is written from the perspective of a retail investor looking to invest in early-stage companies without the networks, access to founders, and sourcing tools of an institutional VC or angel investor. Therefore, I will make reference to the RSF as a “Framework” to aid thinking rather than a valuation methodology. Typically, retail investors without significant capital would invest through crowdsourcing platforms and have zero say in the valuation of the start-up and may not have the chance to meet a founder face-to-face and delve into a company’s IP. As a result, retail investors may use the RSF framework primarily to consider the overall riskiness of a company, rather than a target valuation, though an insight into valuation would still be provided and help inform the final investment decision. However, it’s still useful to understand how the method was intended to work, which is what I have covered in Part 1.

**Suitability for evaluating public / post-revenue companies:** this method would not be suitable for valuing more mature companies, both in public and private markets, as many other data points (e.g. earnings) can be used for valuing late-stage or mature companies. However, some of the risks described by the RSF are universal for all companies and so these posts may still be helpful to engage with.

**A non-institutional approach:** it was suggested that the way different VC’s value start-ups is subjective, and also that the RSF Valuation Method is less likely to be used by institutional venture capitalists and seed investors. I do not disagree with these points, but will respond that professional investors have the ability to interview founders and gain private access to the company’s IP, which is often not available to retail investors. Retail investors without significant capital will typically invest through crowdsourcing platforms (e.g. StartEngine, Wefunder, Seedrs, Crowdcube) and have less information to make a decision on. Retail investors using these platforms also have to deal with a pre-determined valuation and I hypothesise that most companies would therefore be “overvalued”, as the power to set terms (i.e. how much equity to give away and at what price) rests strongly with the company and not the retail investors. Therefore, retail investors cannot use the same approach as institutional VCs and angel investors and a framework for properly evaluating investment opportunities is critical.

**“I am skeptical of any founder and management of start-ups that cannot raise smart money through angel and VC funds.”** This is a great argument in support of developing a robust evaluation method. Although some founders turn to crowdsourcing for honest reasons, I am sure many do so to avoid more stringent due diligence (especially regarding financials) that they would face from an institutional VC. We should be aware that investing in start-ups is high risk, that retail investors likely face more selection risk than institutional VCs due to lack of data/transparency (which is true of most asset classes), and that retail investors need to be careful in allocating capital to start-ups. Target companies should be high conviction, and the resulting portfolio should be well diversified with many small bets. An allocation to seed-stage businesses should also be appropriately sized within a well diversified total portfolio."|investing|Let's Discuss: the Risk Factor Summation Valuation Method, Pt 1|7.0|0.69

First time posting here but I figured this would be a solid place to start to get some feedback on a strategy that I have been using involving about 25% margin and using dividends to pay the interest down. Over the years ive found that when something seems easy, its generally because I’m missing something in the bigger picture which isnt factored into my overall plan so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! This portfolio is founded on higher cap tech heavy stocks leaning towards growth, some value and some less fun index funds, the key component is really focusing it around dividend paying investments…I’ve chosen to omit the actual investments as to not create any bias or general judgement on my holdings. I am simply looking for feedback on this strategy regarding my utilization of margin and how to more effectively use it. So here’s what ive been doing for about the past 6 months. 


I started this portfolio with 10k and have generally been DCA’ing in every week or so and recently I made the decision that on some of my positions the bottom was in and I took about 20 percent margin to buy more. Currently the entire portfolio is worth about 15k and here’s where I am looking for feedback..My plan is just to continue to DCA in as I normally do, pay down a small amount of my margin every month and then when the opportunity arises buy back in using leverage when I feel like a dip presents an opportunity. My margin interest rate is about 6.5% so its not the end of the world and my dividend payout will be used to cover majority of the interest on that anyway. I personally feel that 30% seems to be a safe number however I could be completely wrong. 


I guess my question is, am I utilizing margin effectively or am I making a mistake by paying down margin too quickly where that money could be better utilized by just buying more. What am I missing and/or what are some strategies you use regarding margin for growth heavy stocks? Am I paying my margin down the right way or is it better. Also not looking for “dont use margin”…obviously I am aware of the risks of using margin. 


I know theres a lot that I’m leaving out here with my personal risk tolerance, but I’m just kind of trying to get a feel for the best way to utilize leverage in this weird turbulent market. Another note, I do not wish to exceed 30% margin under any circumstances. This is just a portfolio that I have to learn and develop some skills and not max out margin and try to make as much money as fast as possible.

Hello all,

I am long Regeneron, gave 10 shares @ 497$. Not financial advise. I saw this yesterday and didn't see it discussed, yet.

TLDR: REGENERON received on June 4th the FDA [clearance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW52aXouY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANXXYbaNF8GZL6R6VNc7SFVXmzJXO412QBHXD3v1yXpw-CIsX2AhhbI1FTBY5px_IGMYIh8Pk0SXz8otJFyLmn53RKVUdShJbWzzvebEIeM5LHhV5aEcXMS_RzRN9qqgf91Ojrid7RfQgsv7_hElWuYhfT44Y-uCX_cxSMwFVahB)  to use 1200 mg instead of 2400 mg. it seems this news might boost  income by 13% (assuming that there are little extra cost to implement)  based on the guaranteed US deal until June 30 alone.

I think the timing of this (early June) will impact the stock very positively according to this [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html):

&gt;The  U.S. government will purchase all REGEN-COV doses delivered by June 30,  2021 and may accept additional doses through September 30, 2021 at its  discretion, up to a maximum amount of 1.25 million doses.

Considering  that one former dose is now effectively 2 doses, they will earn double  for basically no extra cost (except packaging and shipping, or maybe  just relabeling the vials, I guess) for doses to be delivered in June.  Depending on how fast this is possible to implement, of course... For  the potential doses until September, I would expect them to have half  the production cost accordingly.

According to this [barron's article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-authorizes-lower-regeneron-covid-19-antibody-dose-that-opens-the-door-to-bigger-sales-51622819267?siteid=yhoof2),

&gt;The lower-dose level would allow it to deliver more doses and could increase the amount of the possible payout, [for a total of up to $2.6 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)  
\[...\]  
Regeneron  now says it expects to deliver at least 1 million doses to the  U.S.  government in the second quarter of the year, depending on   manufacturing operations. At the $2,100 per-dose level implied by the   information Regeneron has provided about its contract, the U.S.   government would pay $2.1 billion for those 1 million doses.

More [specifically](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)

&gt;Under   the new deal, the government will purchase up to 1.25 million doses   delivered by June 30. Hitting that benchmark would be contingent on   Regeneron being authorized to sell the cocktail at a smaller dosage   level than is currently authorized; at the current dosage level, the   company will deliver 750,000 doses by June 30.  
The  company said  that the government would pay $2.625 billion if all 1.25  million doses  are delivered, implying a price of $2,100 per dose. That  is well over  the implied price of $1,500 per treatment course the  company charged in  its first agreement with the government.

So,  from past delivery estimates of 750 k doses to 1 M doses by June 30  would be additional revenue of 250 k \* 2,100 $ = 525 M $ at presumably  little production cost for Regeneron.  According to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=REGN), past sales of 9.2 B $ and income of 4 B $ that would be 5.7% increased sales or 13.1% additional income.

That  is not taking the potential 250 k additional doses that the US might  accept between until and Sept 30. And not taking the European [deal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-secures-55-000-doses-100715709.html) for 55 k doses (if EMA approved) or the Swiss extra 3 k doses into account.

Have there been other cases where the corporate fund managers have made such a profound change to the Board of a large public listed company?

It is also scary how the Blackrock/Vanguard ownership % in public companies year after year. They own presumably 20-30% of most companies on the S&amp;P500. And this includes competing companies. I believe no individual investor, bar fund managers, are allowed to own large stakes in competing companies.

Can someone help me understand what I'm missing.

For example: 

SSO peaked at $82.53 pre covid, it bottomed at $35.74 so you'd be down about 57%

SPY peaked at $337.60 pre covid, it bottomed at $228.80 so you'd be down about 32%

This part makes sense to me, the losses are nearly double with the leveraged ETF however the next part is what I don't understand, it seems to recover just as quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

If you bought SSO at the pre covid peak of $82.53, with the current price of $115.73 you're up about 40%

If you bought SPY at the pre covid peak of $337.60 with the current price of $422.60 you're up about 31%

So despite the far larger drawdown during the covid crash, the SSO has recovered just as fast and is outperforming the SPY.

How is this possible? This is one of the reasons I've read for not buying a leveraged SSO, that if you sit through a drawdown it will take much longer to recover the losses but that doesn't seem to be the case here unless I'm missing something!

Also please note, I understand that the market isn't guaranteed to continue going up and 10 year depressions are possible etc but I'm using a real world example of a drawdown above where despite the far greater initial loss, the leveraged ETF still recovers and outperforms very quickly even if you bought the pre drawdown peak.

Abstract:

Bitcoin users can offer fees to the miners who record transactions on the Blockchain. We document high variation of Bitcoin fees, not only over time, but also within blocks. Further, the blockchain rarely runs at capacity, even though there appears to be excess demand. We argue that this is inconsistent with competitive mining, but is consistent with strategic capacity management. If agents believe that only high fee transactions are executed in a timely fashion then strategic capacity management can be used to increase fee revenue. We note that mining pools facilitate collusion, and estimate that they have extracted least 200 million USD a year in excess fees by making processing artificially capacity scarce."|investing|Miner Collusion and the Bitcoin Protocol|156.0|0.85

(had pic but refer to chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/))

There  are other articles about meme $WKHS from Bloomberg, Motley, and The  Street as well if you want to check for yourself. That made me  suspicious. I’d been watching this ticker for a while and there was no  movement around $WKHS – unless I really did miss that?

Not a great report, but not terrible either.

Some key highlights:

• Jobs added 559k vs. 675k estimate 

• Unemployment fell to 5.8%

• Strong hourly earnings 

• Labor participation rate edged lower


In my opinion, the biggest concern here is the drop in the labor participation rate. People are clearly not motivated to come back to work. Been hearing countless stories of small business struggling to hire - ultimately people need to be incentivized to come back. I would expect wages to continue climbing (earnings were up +0.5% MoM) until this gap closes.

Powell is less likely to taper now near-term until further progress is made with closing the labor-market gap.

It's been a couple of days since this made news but Abbvie is being investigated for tax related malpractices.

https://www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/abbvie-faces-pressure-from-us-senate-over-taxes

Now, I'm not an expert on taxes or related laws, so my understanding on this matter is limited. From what I got, it seems that Abbvie hasn't been caught breaking any tax laws and hence there's only an investigation that has been launched and not a lawsuit. What the investigation will expose remains to be seen.

What this be an appropriate understanding of what's happening?

I am long on Abbvie and bought it when it was in mid-high double digits. So I have a fair bit of profit on this investment. My original strategy was to hold it for another 2 years and depending on whether they come up with an equivalent for Humira, hold it longer.

1) PSTH and UMG are not one company now.  Rather, PSTH is purchasing UMG shares when they begin trading in Europe, and then giving them to the PSTH shareholders.  They will be worth about $14.75 each. This satisfies the SPAC conditions, and so PSTH does not need to rush to merge with an actual company.  Rather,   each PSTH holder will own 1 share of UMG at $14.75 and 1 share of PSTH at $5.25.  This is just what the shares are “worth” and not what they will actually be trading at.  I cannot tell you what they’ll be trading at because I am not a psychic.

2) PSTH will continue to search for a company to merge with with about $1.5B left in their trust value.  There is no time limit in this because their SPAC conditions were already satisfied.  The deal could happen next week, or in 5 years, only time will tell.

3) Each PSTH shareholder will receive one right to purchase SPARC.  These rights are exercisable at $20.  The rights cannot be exercised until a merger has been completed, and they are gifted to the shareholder, so there is no opportunity cost of holding.  This is important, because as SPARC is not a SPAC, there is not the traditional two year time frame to find a target.

4) For anyone unfamiliar with rights, they are familiar to options.  If SPARC is trading at $30, the right is worth about $30-$20=$10.  Because they cannot be exercised in this scenario until a merger is complete, you are risking no capital by waiting.

SUMMARY:
I may have missed something, so let me know if that is the case, or if anyone has any other questions.  Don’t be alarmed if PSTH is in the red tomorrow, as this is a very complex deal and the market does not like complexity.  We just need to give it time to absorb the information.

The Vancouver-based company, which reported earnings after markets closed on Thursday, said net sales hit $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up from $651 million during the same time last year. Lululemon also reported a net income of $145 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $29 million last year, or 22 cents per diluted share. 

""Our first quarter results reflected strength across all drivers of growth, fuelled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business and a rebound in brick and mortar stores,"" chief executive Calvin McDonald said in a statement released after markets closed on Thursday. 

""Our strong performance across categories, channels and geographies demonstrates the momentum and strength of Lululemon as we shift into the new normal.""

Lululemon said traffic to its bricks and mortar stores increased significantly in the first quarter of the year, with 93 per cent of the company's retail stores open by the end of the three month period. 

The company also saw growth in both its women's and men's categories. Sales of women's products increased 23 per cent when compared to 2019 sales, and men's sales jumped 27 per cent compared to 2019.

McDonald expects that momentum to continue, even as economies reopen and customers begin to resume normal routines. He said sales growth has continued, even as consumers shift their daily habits. 

""We have not seen a meaningful shift in our activewear categories through the first quarter,"" McDonald said. 

""The big piece of our business and sales are in athletic activewear. I think with that, it has embedded strength to not be purely trend driven or fashion driven... Overall growth is across almost every category and is very balanced across geographies."" 

The stronger-than-expected results pushed Lululemon to raise its sales targets for the full fiscal year. The company now expects net revenue to be between $5.83 billion and $5.91 billion in 2021, up from its prior range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Lululemon also expects adjusted earnings to be between $6.73 and $6.86 per share, compared to a prior range of $6.30 to $6.45. 

The projections surpass what analysts had anticipated. According to IBES data from Refinitiv, analysts had expected net revenue of $5.68 billion and earnings of $6.48 per share.

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.


Chips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.

A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration’s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.

The president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump’s order while it crafted its new policy framework.

The move is part of Biden’s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world’s two most powerful countries.

Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.

Senior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating “repression or serious human rights abuses”.

“We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,” a second senior administration official said.

Investors would have time to “unwind” investments, a third official said.

The new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.

But some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.

In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China’s military."|investing|Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors|4228.0|0.97

* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share.

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A &amp; B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

That being said, today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid and made the following statement:

***""Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***

And finally, a potential dark horse suitor has emerged...or re-emerged, I should say.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( WBA ) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen ( ABC ) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal.  With that $6.5 billion windfall, Walgreens is now is a position to purchase the remainder of Rite Aid, finally completing the acquisition that it set out to accomplish way back in 2015.  Such an acquisition would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  

\* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS 

\* Providing Walgreens with a PBM to help it gain share in the prescription drug market and become more competitive in that segment

\* Blocking both Amazon and Walmart from acquiring Rite Aid as part of their pharmacy strategy which would quickly catapult either company into the position of 3rd largest retail pharmacy in the USA  

The race appears to be on to see who will ultimately acquire Rite Aid! 

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. I personally believe that the stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

I see the solid investors who stick to index funds, solid blue chip companies and looking to build wealth over time. Warren Buffett being the classic example of this. 

Then there's the ones who are massive risk takers, borrowing money, trying to YOLO and make millions by the end of the year. Every now and again you hear of someone succeeding but far more fail. 

As I've got older and more experienced I feel like I've gone from the risk taker to the solid investor but now I'm thinking why not have a hybrid strategy depending on your investment goals? 

After all emotion can mess up even the most solid investors. The dot com crash, 2008 and March 2020 when plenty of people who had been investing for years cashed out their shares at a huge loss.  

I was aware of bitcoin from about 2011. I always knew it was massively volatile so I avoided it and stuck to investing in good old solid returns. But (and I'm sure other people have thought this) why didn't I just put a few hundred dollars in and forget about it? That one 100 bagger can eclipse all the returns of my solid investments.

Now there's NFT's, meme stocks and no doubt there will be plenty of other latest fads. 

It's not for everyone but I have decided to invest a minimum of 5% and never more than 10% of my net wealth into highly speculative, possibly go to zero investments. By always sticking to these percentages I figure if I do catch the next bitcoin ten years away then it's worth the risk. If not then I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

A poll of analysts predicts a 663,000 rise in employment for last month following April’s surprisingly weak 266,000 result, which was less than a third of the expected 1mln hires. The headline jobless rate for May is forecast to fall to 5.9% after the surprise increase to 6.1% in the previous month, and average earnings are seen up sharply on the year.

*Gaming Industry*

Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

&amp;#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to [surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-esports-growth-idUSFLM4K2cJ7) in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry."|investing|A few notes about Corsair Gaming (CRSR) - The Rise of The Gamer|39.0|0.67

On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population &gt; 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring &gt; 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&amp;J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery. 

UPDATE AS OF 6/3

New Motley Fool commentary.

“Entering last month, Heron Therapeutics had two FDA-approved drugs on the market. Both were designed to treat nausea in cancer patients. But in mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Heron's post-surgical pain relief drug Zynrelef. The therapy combines a local anesthetic with an anti-inflammatory drug, and is administered as part of the surgical process. The delayed-release medication provides pain relief for 72 hours after surgery. Heron management believes this is key in helping post-surgical patients avoid the use of opioid pain medications.

The FDA approval was given for a limited set of surgeries: bunionectomy, total knee replacement, and a type of hernia repair. Those account for more than 2.1 million procedures annually, with 60% of those performed in an outpatient setting. Management has indicated it sees the potential for Zynrelef to hit $450 million in annual sales. Heron's other pain management candidate, HTX-034, recently entered phase 2 clinical trials. It aims to extend the pain relief to five to seven days. 

Given a boost from a federal budget that includes significant funds for research and raising awareness about addiction, Heron's opioid alternatives could quickly gain wide adoption in the medical community. Beyond public service campaigns and a speedier approval process, agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could create incentives for surgeons to use opioid alternatives like Zynrelef. There could also be regulatory support for its use in additional indications. There is already a precedent for Zynrelef's use beyond those initial surgeries approved by the FDA. The drug is authorized in 31 European countries for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. All of this adds up to a significant opportunity for Heron Therapeutics to grow its sales.”

This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated.

DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing.

Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up.

**Finances**

First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:

2017: 62.76B

2018: 70.85B

2019: 71.97B

2020: 77.87B

Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:

In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.

In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.

In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.

In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.

**Competition/Growth Potential**

Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of \~$68 in April at \~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth.

Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota.

**Final Thoughts**

Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.

Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market.

What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?

# Assessment of the Uranium Market and Future Outlook

**Disclaimer and disclosure:** I am not a financial advisor and none of the below research constitutes investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell. Always do your own due diligence. I currently have small positions in some of the securities mentioned.

**Note:** Any constructive criticism to improve this DD would be welcome. If you see any red flags or risks I may have missed, please highlight them.

# Highlights

* After a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is improving. The construction of new reactors is on the rise, particularly in Asia, and nuclear energy is increasingly seen as essential to helping countries meet their decarbonization targets.
* After Fukushima, uranium supply flooded the market and demand fell, particularly in Japan and Germany, leading to low uranium prices for years. In response to these tough market conditions, mining companies have scaled back production in an attempt to balance a market saturated with the metal. Low uranium prices have also prevented miners from committing to large-scale investments in new mining projects, resulting in uncertainty in future supply.
* Uranium is primarily sold not on the open market but through private, long-term contracts. But given an oversupply of uranium and cheap prices on the spot market, contracted volume has been low for several years as utilities and reactor operators draw on the secondary supply, such as purchasing on the spot market, to make up the deficit between what is delivered through older contracts and what reactors require to keep running.
* But as the secondary supply dwindles and miners maintain production discipline, utilities will face a projected supply shortage and will eventually be incentivized to enter into long-term contracts at higher prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds—a new development for the market—signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply.
* Optimistic investors, market analysts, and industry CEOs largely believe the bear market is ending and a new uranium bull market is emerging. They predict that in the coming decade, demand is set to grow as supply tightens, and as a result, uranium prices will rise (indeed, *must* rise) to incentivize new mining production and fill demand.

# Introduction

This report examines the current uranium market and the thesis that, as demand for nuclear energy grows and supply dwindles, utilities will have to sign new long-term contracts for uranium delivery, causing the price of uranium to increase and initiate a new bull market. While this report covers the uranium market, the politics of nuclear energy, and upcoming catalysts, it does not analyze any specific uranium stocks nor does it recommend any particular investment strategies.

Like most mineral commodity markets, uranium has a history of volatility and typically moves with supply and demand as well as geopolitical forces. For context, in 2017, the world’s top uranium producers were Kazakhstan (39% of world production), Canada (22%), and Australia (10%) with Namibia, Niger, and Uzbekistan playing smaller roles in the market. The largest and most significant uranium [exploration and mining companies](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx) include state-owned Kazatomprom (22% of world production), France’s Orano (11%), Cameco (9%), Uranium One (8%), and CNNC (7%). Finally, the [most productive uranium mine](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/uranium-mining-overview.aspx) is Cigar Lake in Canada (owned by Cameco/Orano with 13% of world production). Notably, Cameco’s McArthur River mine, the world’s largest high-grade uranium deposit, was placed under care and maintenance in 2018 due to low uranium prices.

Before uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors, it goes through a process known as the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle where the uranium is (1) mined and milled into U3O8 (also known as yellowcake, a uranium concentrate powder), (2) converted into UF6, (3) enriched, and then (4) fabricated into fuel. This process is time-consuming and geographically spread out; over the course of 1-2 years, uranium might be mined in Canada, converted and enriched in France, and sent to fuel a reactor in the United States, and utility inventories of uranium might be spread out along this cycle with only a small portion of it immediately ready to fuel a reactor.

# Sentiment on Nuclear Energy

As [one article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/14/is-denison-mines-stock-a-buy/) puts it, “nuclear power has been something of an unloved stepchild in the energy sector.” Indeed, since the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public opinion has been focused on safety and environmental concerns. In Europe, Germany has reduced their number of reactors from [17 to 6](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/germany.aspx) (and the remaining six are scheduled to be decommissioned by the end of 2022), with the German public broadly opposed to constructing new reactors. In the U.S., according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as of November 2019, there were [23](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php) nuclear power reactors in various stages of decommissioning, with only two new reactors being built.

So is nuclear energy on its way out? Probably not.

In France, where 56 reactors operate, officials recently [extended](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/france-extend-lifetime-old-nuclear-102331515.html) the 40-year lifespan of nuclear plants an additional 10 years. In March, China released its 14th 5-year plan, which [aims](https://www.power-technology.com/news/industry-news/china-five-year-plan-three-points-nuclear-coal-energy-efficiency/) for 70GW of power generation through nuclear energy before 2025 (it hit 51GW in 2020), and the country is currently [building](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx) 16 new reactors to meet this goal. In India, 9 new reactors are under construction. In the U.S., described in more detail below, the Biden administration has adopted a positive stance towards nuclear energy, and some U.S. reactors are starting to [receive](https://www.powermag.com/nrc-issues-first-subsequent-license-renewals-extends-nuclear-reactor-life-to-80-years/) license renewals to operate beyond their original lifespan. Nuclear energy, though it can be controversial even among some experts, is increasingly seen as [essential](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate) to meeting decarbonization targets. Overall, the number of new reactors is expected to outpace shutdowns, and as a result, the demand for uranium is projected to increase 1-3% per year in the coming decades.

# Market Overview

Global demand for uranium rose from the 1950s through the 1970s, largely driven by nuclear weapons procurement programs. Then, in the 1980s, various environmental, safety, and economic concerns over nuclear power plants reduced demand; at the same time, the market was flooded with excess uranium, and prices remained depressed throughout the 1990s. As uranium prices fell, producers began curtailing operations or exiting the business entirely, leaving only a few actively involved in uranium mining and causing uranium inventories to shrink significantly.

Uranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing about $7/lb. This was followed by a period of gradual rise (during which three mines either flooded or suffered extreme weather, tightening supply and causing the price to increase further), followed by a bubble culminating in mid-2007, during which the price peaked at around $137/lb. The higher price during the bubble spurred new prospecting and reopening of old mines.

The Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, however, sparked renewed fears about the safety of nuclear reactors and set in motion a decade-long bear market. Demand fell as Japan took all of their reactors offline, and prices ultimately reached a low of around $18/lb. in November 2016 before hitting about $29/lb. in April 2021. The low price of uranium has caused some mining companies to leave the business entirely, such as Westwater Resources (previously Uranium Resources); by [some estimates](http://uraniumequities.com/uranium-reports/2018/10/Canaccord-Uranium-Time-U-Move.pdf), there were nearly 600 uranium mining companies in 2011, but today there are only about 50.

Significantly, prices still remain far below the [$50-$60/lb.](https://www.urnmetf.com/posts/uranium-prices-inflection-point) figure often cited as the all-in cost of production (though some companies can produce for much cheaper), and as long as the spot price remains below the cost of production, mining companies will lack incentive to add more uranium to the market, invest in new mines, or engage in higher-cost production. (Some sources distinguish between the all-in cost of production, which Canada’s [Skyharbour Resources](https://skyharbourltd.com/projects/uranium-projects/uranium-overview/) estimates at around $40/lb., and the “incentive price,” estimated at $50-$60/lb., needed to spur meaningful new production.)

As a result of weak uranium prices and in an effort to reduce available supply, mining companies have strategically cut back on uranium production over the last few years. According to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-uranium-miners-glow-is-temporary-1512508637?mod=article_inline), in 2017 both Kazatomprom and Cameco, two of the three largest mining companies, reduced or suspended production at uranium mines, and other high-cost mines have been idled or closed down. Further, mines can take more than a decade to plan, build, and begin operation, but low uranium prices make these kinds of large long-term investments financially unsound. As Cameco put it in their [Q1 2021 earnings call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf), “Given the timelines it takes, we should be investing now to replace that lost production, but at today’s prices, that makes zero sense.” As a result, over the last few years, production of mined uranium (i.e., the primary supply) has not kept up with demand, and utility companies have had to purchase uranium from secondary sources such as the spot market, stockpiles, re-enriched depleted uranium tails, and ex-military weapons-grade uranium to keep their reactors going.

The vast majority of uranium is not sold on the open market but through private, long-term contracts between buyers (usually utility companies) and sellers (usually mining companies) with delivery typically beginning about two years after the signing of the contract. In addition, the amount delivered can usually be adjusted plus or minus some percent, depending on the utility companies’ needs, and the price to deliver the uranium may be adjusted with changes in the spot market; Cameco, for instance, targets a ratio of 40% fixed-pricing and 60% market-related pricing in their portfolio of long-term contracts. Roughly [76% of U.S.-purchased uranium](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/table7.php) delivered in 2020 was bought through long-term contracts and about 24% through spot market purchases. (This is actually historically low; in 2006, it was 90% long term, reflecting the fact that utilities have been relying more on spot purchases in recent years.) There is some speculation that the spot price of uranium will begin to rise when utility companies sign new long-term contracts, a scenario discussed in more detail under “Long-term Contracts.""

## Supply and Demand

Tracking the current levels of supply and demand of uranium can be extremely useful for determining if utilities will begin to enter long-term contracts or continue to purchase from the spot market or other sources. So, how much supply of uranium is in the market and how much demand is there for that supply? Roughly speaking, each year, about 175-180 million lbs. of uranium are consumed globally. Of that, about 120 million lbs. are supplied by miners and the rest is made up from secondary supplies and utility inventories. Though the exact size of the secondary market is difficult to estimate, [Uranium 2020: Resources, Production and Demand](https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-12/7555_uranium_-_resources_production_and_demand_2020__web.pdf), a joint report by the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, suggests the figure is around 10,000 metric tons per year, or 22 million lbs., suggesting a structural deficit between supply and demand that is made up by drawing on material that utilities already have in inventory.

As I mentioned above, in recent years, mining companies have been intentionally reducing the primary supply of uranium on the market. Over the past decade, the primary supply has continually fallen short of global demand, causing a deficit that is filled by a limited and, as the thesis goes, dwindling secondary supply. We can see from the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx) that after the 2017 production cuts, mined uranium only covered about 80% of world demand.

Tracking secondary supply is both more difficult and more important as its reserves are a key indicator of when utilities will need to enter into long-term contracts. Secondary supply includes stockpiles and inventories of natural and enriched uranium, both civilian and military in origin; nuclear fuel from the reprocessing of spent reactor fuels and from surplus military plutonium; underfeeding; and uranium produced by the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails. The World Nuclear Association’s [*Nuclear Fuel Report*](https://www.world-nuclear.org/getmedia/b488c502-baf9-4142-8d12-42bab97593c3/nuclear-fuel-report-2019-expanded-summary-final.pdf.aspx) notes, “The majority of secondary supplies are derived from uranium that has undergone transformation in reactors, enrichment plants and reprocessing facilities. The second largest potential secondary resource by mass is the world’s inventory of not-yet-treated used nuclear fuel, held largely at reactor sites.” While this inventory normally accounts for only a relatively small portion of total supply, with low uranium prices and limited mining production, this source has become more significant not only for primary producers and utilities but also for traders and holding companies.

BMO Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley have also written research notes [predicting](https://www.mining.com/stars-are-aligning-for-uranium-price-rally/) “a rally in \[uranium\] prices over the next few years to the \~$50 \[per pound\] level by 2024.” Importantly, both groups also point to uncertainty surrounding just how long existing inventories will last:

&gt;Morgan Stanley warns that “the opacity of the inventory situation remains a key uncertainty to price—see for example palladium, which needed almost 7 years of deficit before the price really took off.” BMO says given the still-high levels of inventories, “acute shortages and price squeezes are extremely unlikely, both for this year and the foreseeable future,” adding that “there is no obvious need for new mine supply in the near future.”

These are important sources of uncertainty that are worth paying attention to. If the uranium bull thesis of an imminent supply deficit ends up being wrong, a miscalculation of existing inventories and market supply will likely be one of the main reasons why (this would, of course, just delay the thesis, if all other factors remained equal). With that said, I somewhat disagree with BMO’s assessment (or maybe just their use of the phrase “near future”), as there is evidence that new/more primary production will be needed by the middle or end of the decade, meaning companies should be investing in those projects today. Remember, utilities and miners operate on a longer timescale than other markets; they sign contracts for 5-10 years, and a reactor with only two years’ worth of uranium is operating akin to just-in-time delivery.

**Now, what about demand?** According to the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/home.aspx), there are currently 443 reactors in operation and 52 under construction. Although these reactors require an established, predictable amount of uranium, demand for the metal can still be difficult to estimate, since delays in the construction of new reactors as well as license renewals of old ones can add complications. In the U.S., reactors require about one-fourth of global demand, about 45 million lbs. per year. In February, Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder [speculated](https://www.barrons.com/articles/uranium-miner-cameco-gets-boost-from-sunnier-outlook-for-nuclear-plants-51612283697) that the planned closure of 12 U.S. nuclear power plants this decade could be postponed beyond 2030, adding 26 million pounds to 2021-2030 uranium demand.” Indeed, license renewal has been a growing topic of interest among nuclear and policy experts (as an example, Virginia’s Surry Power Station was [recently granted](https://apnews.com/article/business-f07aefe6a8f4a2fd2a549113bbf1e925) a 20-year extension and several more U.S. renewals are [under review](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nuclear-industry-sees-opportunities-in-dc-as-infrastructure-talks-heat-up-64165577); even Japan has given the [green light](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/japan-utility-restart-nuclear-reactors-77365378) to operate three reactors for an additional 20 years, helping reach its goal of having 20-22% of its energy come from nuclear power by 2030). Further, we’ve also seen reports that the Biden administration supports subsidies for nuclear plants to prevent them from closing, and Biden’s climate adviser [supports](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-climate-adviser-says-existing-nuclear-essential-reach-emissions-2021-05-18/) the continued operation of existing nuclear reactors to achieve emissions goals—more on this under “Political and Policy Developments.” Winder adds that a shift “could lead U.S. fuel buyers to move forward plans for major new contracting: Consider that those 26 million pounds are 23% of total U.S. utility inventories at year-end 2019 of 113 million pounds, and inventories today are quite likely lower post 2020’s supply disruptions.” If reactors are kept online longer than expected, utilities would only face greater urgency to sign new contracts for nuclear fuel.

## Political and Policy Developments

## United States

In the United States, throughout his tenure, President Trump exhibited a positive stance towards nuclear energy. In 2018, two U.S. uranium miners, Energy Fuels Inc and Ur-Energy Corporation, filed a Section 232 petition, essentially asking the government to investigate national security concerns regarding foreign uranium imports and asking that 25% of U.S. uranium consumption be met by U.S. producers. Though the Trump administration [ultimately rejected](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/US-President-rejects-uranium-import-restrictions) this petition, it established the Nuclear Fuel Working Group to find alternative solutions to “restore American nuclear energy leadership.” Framed as a way to increase national security and revitalize domestic uranium production, the Working Group [aimed](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f74/Restoring%20America%27s%20Competitive%20Nuclear%20Advantage-Blue%20version%5B1%5D.pdf) to “restore America’s competitive nuclear \[energy\] advantages” and recommended, among other initiatives, to “directly purchase uranium by establishing a uranium reserve.” In December 2020, Congress passed the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf) to fund the government through fiscal year 2021, which set aside $75 million for the Uranium Reserve Program, but the project is still in the early stages and it does not appear that any uranium purchases have actually been made by the U.S. government. (More information on the nuclear- and uranium-related provisions of the 2021 appropriations law can be found [here](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Congress-approves-nuclear-energy-funding-for-FY202).)

The Biden administration has taken a similarly positive stance towards uranium and nuclear energy. Though there hasn’t been much headline news on the topic, nuclear energy is included in one of the objectives of the [American Jobs Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) to leverage “carbon pollution-free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower” and to manufacture “critical technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and fuel.” Separately, Reuters recently [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-eyes-subsidies-nuclear-plants-help-meet-climate-targets-sources-2021-05-05/), “The White House has signaled privately to lawmakers and stakeholders in recent weeks that it supports taxpayer subsidies to keep nuclear facilities from closing and making it harder to meet U.S. climate goals.” Biden’s recently [proposed 2022 budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf), which will likely change before being signed into law, requests $9.75 billion in credits for “electricity generation from existing nuclear power facilities” and $5 billion to “procure advanced nuclear power” over the next ten years.

Furthermore, there is currently a bill in the Senate—[S.4897](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4897/text), the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act—that aims to “to reestablish United States global leadership in nuclear energy, revitalize domestic nuclear energy supply chain infrastructure, support the licensing of advanced nuclear technologies, and improve the regulation of nuclear energy.” The bill has been [approved](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/committee-approves-nuclear-infrastructure-legislation-at-business-meeting) by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but, so far, has not been passed or signed into law.

A smaller, but still positive, signal for the uranium market is that Honeywell’s Metropolis Works plant in Illinois—the U.S.’s sole uranium conversion facility—will [restart](https://www.powermag.com/honeywell-to-reopen-sole-u-s-uranium-conversion-plant/) production of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) by early 2023, citing customer demand and the depletion of secondary supplies of UF6. The plant was idled in 2018 due to the weak market.

## European Union

In the European Union, [countries are divided](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29616/for-eastern-europe-nuclear-power-depends-on-eu-taxonomy) on nuclear energy, with Germany and Austria opposing it and France, Hungary, and eastern Europe supporting it. In March 2021, the Joint Research Center of the European Commission on nuclear energy released a [report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/210329-jrc-report-nuclear-energy-assessment_en.pdf) to help the Commission determine whether nuclear energy should be included in the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, which would help incentivize and scale up investment in the industry. (This report followed a previous assessment from the Technical Expert Group \[TEG\] that found “nuclear energy has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions” but that more research was needed due to a “lack of operational permanent experience of high-level waste disposal sites.”) The JRC report concludes that there is no evidence that “nuclear energy does more harm to human health or to the environment than other electricity production technologies already included in the Taxonomy.” The report adds, “The nuclear energy-based electricity production and the associated activities in the whole nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. uranium mining, nuclear fuel fabrication, etc.) do not represent significant harm to any of the TEG \[Technical Expert Group\] objectives.” While this is a positive sign for EU endorsement of nuclear energy, some uncertainty remains. This report is currently being [reviewed](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/e%20n/qanda_21_1805) by two sets of independent experts, the Group of Experts on radiation protection and waste management under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks on environmental impacts. The two Committees have three months to issue their assessment, and the two assessment reports, along with the JRC report, will inform the Commission's decision.

## Non-utility Purchasing of Uranium

One final significant development in the uranium market is the purchasing and stockpiling of the metal by non-utility companies, particularly miners and physical asset management companies, signaling growing positive sentiment in the market. Mining companies may buy uranium for a variety of reasons, such as in order to meet purchase agreements or to build up collateral, but the recent moves also suggest renewed optimism that uranium prices may finally be ready to move up. In its Q1 2021 financial results, Cameco [noted](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-2021-Q1-MDA-FS-and-Notes.pdf) that, in total, “Through April this year junior uranium companies and financial funds had purchased approximately 10.5 million pounds U3O8.” (Additionally, pp. 7-8 of that link provides a good overview of the most recent developments in the uranium market.) Some recent purchases by miners include:

* In March, Australia’s **Boss Resources** [agreed to purchase](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) 1.25 million pounds of U3O8
* In March, **Uranium Royalty Corp.** (URC) [exercised](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) its option to buy 348,000 lbs from Yellow Cake. Notably, URC has the option to acquire anywhere from $2.5-$10 million worth of uranium per year from Yellow Cake for nine years, so the fact that they bought the maximum amount is an optimistic sign, and investors should watch for a similar purchase in Q1 2022.
* In March, **Denison Mines** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-successful-procurement-of-2-5-million-lbs-u3o8-as-part-of-project-finance-initiative-301260450.html) 2.5 million lbs.
* In April, **Uranium Energy Corp.** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uranium-energy-corp-expands-physical-uranium-initiative-to-purchase-2-1-million-pounds-u3o8-and-announces-financing-301262497.html) 2.1 million lbs. scheduled to be delivered at various points through 2023. Then, in May, they [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334933/000118374021000106/ex991-20210520uec.htm) an additional 200,000 lb. purchase.
* In April, **enCore Energy** [purchased](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/encore-energy-corp-announces-strategic-acquisition-of-physical-uranium-865933152.html) 200,000 lbs.
* In May, **Cameco** [said](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Cameco-increases-uranium-purchases-to-meet-contrac) that it expects to purchase 11-13 million lbs. of uranium in 2021 to meet contracted demand, which is up from their previous estimate of 8-10 million lbs.

Trusts and funds have also been buying up uranium, with London-listed Yellow Cake purchasing nearly 4 million pounds in March 2021 by exercising an option to buy from Kazatomprom, bringing its [total holdings](https://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/yellow_cake/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=2392&amp;newsid=1470152) to 12.96 million lbs. In April, Sprott Asset Management [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/28/2218439/0/en/Sprott-Asset-Management-Enters-Into-Agreement-With-Uranium-Participation-Corporation-to-Form-the-Sprott-Physical-Uranium-Trust.html) that it would take over management of and restructure the Uranium Participation Corporation to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) and list it on the NYSE—UPC currently holds 16.27 million lbs. of U3O8 and 660,000 lbs. of UF6.

One of the main effects of these uranium holding companies purchasing the commodity is that they remove supply from the spot market, thus limiting the amount available for miners and utilities to buy and further pressuring utilities to enter into long-term contracts. There is also speculation that Sprott’s upcoming purchases on the spot market will drive the uranium price up, making spot purchases less attractive for utilities. Sprott will likely utilize at-the-market raisings so that if its share price trades at a premium to NAV, it will issue new shares, raise funds, and purchase additional uranium. As one article [puts](https://articles.cruxinvestor.com/sprotts-physical-uranium-trust-to-change-the-uranium-game) it, “ATM \[At-the-market\] raisings are a well-worn path for Sprott, having raised around $4B this way into their bullion trusts over the past 15 months. This structure will enable SPUT to consistently nibble (if not gobble) at the bid in the spot market—the perfect way to fray fuel buyer nerves and terrify producers that need to obtain spot uranium for their contracted deliveries.”

The Sprott transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 (the shareholder meeting is currently set for July 7) and seek a listing on the NYSE. Sprott already manages four other physical commodity trusts across gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, and the addition of uranium suggests strong investor interest in the commodity. Cameco [called](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/new-uranium-trust-could-be-game-changer-for-spot-market-cameco-says-64158423) the move by Sprott a “game changer” for the spot market. (I’ll add that the [Q1 2021 Cameco call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf) had some interesting things to say about Sprott \[on pp. 33 and 50\] as well as the miner purchases \[pp. 32-33, 39-40\].)

# Long-term Contracts

As noted above, the majority of uranium purchased by utilities comes from long-term contracts. Based on UxC data (found in a [Cameco report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312521035711/d121720dex3.htm)), the last significant contracting “cycle” was from 2005-2012 with large numbers of contracting volumes from 2005-2007, 2010, and 2012. Since then, long-term contracting has dropped significantly, particularly from 2019 to 2020, where the volume of long-term contracting went from 95.8 million lbs. to about 53 million lbs. At the same time, spot contracting increased to \~80 million lbs. in 2020, the highest level in the past two decades (I apologize for the less-than-ideal quality of the chart; the fault is Cameco’s or UxC’s). In Cameco’s view, lower contracting volumes in 2020 could be attributed in part to “utilities focusing on operational safety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.” During 2020, there were also a number of U.S. policy uncertainties stemming from the Nuclear Fuel Working Group and the [Russian Suspension Agreement](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/100620-new-russian-uranium-suspension-agreement-takes-effect-says-commerce).

One way of thinking about where utilities are today in terms of contracting is to look at how much uranium utilities anticipate needing each year compared to how much they’ve already contracted for delivery. As I mentioned above, when utilities sign long-term contracts the amount delivered can vary some amount to meet their needs, so there’s a minimum and maximum range that might be delivered to utilities. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) [2020 Uranium Marketing Annual Report](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/), which just came out in May, gives us a helpful chart (below) showing the maximum amount of uranium already under contract as well as the unfilled market requirements (i.e., what utilities need but haven’t contracted for). Combined, these values give us the maximum anticipated market requirements of uranium for U.S. nuclear reactors. We see that even as overall demand remains relatively steady, the maximum contracted amount of uranium falls steeply throughout the decade. For the next one to two years, that shortfall might be able to be made up by purchasing on the spot market or drawing on existing utility inventories, but considering that long-term contracts typically begin uranium delivery two years after the contract is signed, utilities will likely need to sign new contracts soon.

Ultimately, no one knows when utilities will start to enter into long-term contracts again, but we know their inventories are shrinking, demand is growing, and future supply is becoming more uncertain as miners and investment funds purchase additional uranium from the spot market.

# Market Performance

How has the uranium market responded to all of these events? Generally, equities have run ahead of the spot price to the point where, since December of last year, many miners have doubled or tripled in share price. Year to date (up to May 27), the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) is up 43% and the North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) is up 50%. Other notable uranium stocks are also strong, including Denison Mines (DNN, +78%), Uranium Energy Corp (UEC, +73%), Cameco (CCJ, +46%), NexGen Energy (NXE, +62%), and Energy Fuels (UUUU, +50%) among others. The spot price, on the other hand, has remained around $30/lb.

If you look at any of the charts for these equities, you see a spike around December, marking when a [Bear Traps Report](https://www.thebeartrapsreport.com/) on uranium went out, and the URNM ETF saw record inflows. Looking at the charts, it can be tempting to think it’s too late to get in. Even buying two or three months ago would put one in a good position leading up to catalysts in the second half of the year. But in a lot of ways the bull market is just getting started. The spot price is still currently sitting around $30/lb., and analysts like [Canaccord](https://app.box.com/s/y6evjvtwf7qmvlw02puz5utokmtcs52f) predict the price may reach $60/lb. by the end of 2025. For me, the run-up in equities and the upcoming catalysts, like the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, mean I can’t be as patient as I’d like when building my positions.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Investors who believe a new uranium bull market is on the horizon or who are looking for additional evidence should keep the following catalysts in mind, in no particular order:

* The **European Union** is set to decide, around June 2021, whether nuclear energy should be considered as part of its taxonomy of sustainable activities. Though Germany has notably turned away from nuclear energy, if the EU considers nuclear energy to be clean and safe, it would pave the way for more reactors in central and eastern Europe.
* In the U.S., investors should **watch for the establishment of a uranium reserve** (for which $75 million has already been allocated for 2021) and the passage of the Nuclear Infrastructure Act.
* **Watch for updates on mining production.** If miners continue to show production discipline, supply will be limited.
* **Watch for updates on reactor license renewals.** If a reactor/plant receives a license renewal, that will represent an increase in uranium demand that likely did not appear in projections.
* **Watch for continued uranium purchases from non-utility entities**, as this limits supply on the spot market and will encourage the signing of long-term contracts.
* **Watch for the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**, expected in the third quarter of 2021—this is the most significant near-term catalyst, in my opinion.
* **Watch for news on long-term contracts.** I suspect any new contracts would be announced during quarterly financial results, though earlier indicators may come in the form of a rising spot price or share price of a mining stock.

# Risks and Uncertainty

Though a number of market observers anticipate an increase in the price of uranium due to growing demand and tightening supply, some uncertainty and risk remains.

* Uranium inventory and supply may be greater than estimated, which might delay the bull market by years.
* Producer discipline may break down in the next few years, leading to additional uranium supply on the market and reducing the chances of a dramatic price increase.
* In my research, I have yet to come across any articles or interviews from the perspective of utilities that examine why they are delaying signing long-term contracts and risking security of supply. Knowing this would provide a fuller picture of market dynamics.
* Although the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx) estimates that roughly 50 nuclear reactors are being constructed today, it’s not uncommon for these projects to be canceled or postponed, reducing the demand for uranium they would have required if they were up and running.
* Black swan event: the possibility of another Fukushima-like nuclear disaster would significantly dampen demand for uranium and nuclear energy.

# Conclusion

After a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is once again improving. But low uranium prices over the past several years have led to underinvestment in the sector, leading to a lack of new mining projects to fill projected demand. As a result, utilities may face a supply crunch in the coming years and will eventually be pressured to enter into long-term contracts at higher uranium prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds—a new development for the market—signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply. Investors hoping to profit from a potential bull market should expect a volatile 2-4-year trade, especially if they choose to hold positions in individual miners and explorers, though they may also choose to mitigate that volatility by holding ETFs or physical asset companies."|investing|Assessment of the Uranium Market and Future Outlook (long post)|223.0|0.92

The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to remove a 2018 rule that forbid banks from facilitating cryptocurrency trades comes as a welcome relief for a community facing push-back from traditional lenders needed to help settle these deals.

The regulator late on Monday told banks not to cite a 2018 central bank circular as a reason to hinder crypto trades. The 2018 note had forbid banks from facilitating such transactions, but has since been struck down by the Supreme Court. Banks must continue with other routine due diligence measures on the deals, the RBI said.

”The circular is no longer valid from the date of the Supreme Court judgment, and therefore cannot be cited or quoted from,” the RBI said.

The RBI order follows local media reports that financial firms, including SBI Cards &amp; Payment Services Ltd., one of India’s biggest credit card issuers, and the nation’s largest private-sector bank HDFC Bank Ltd. had cautioned customers against dealing in virtual currencies. Indian authorities have repeatedly expressed concern that crypto assets could be used for criminal activity such as money laundering and funding terrorism.

“Investing in crypto has always been 100% legal in India and the new RBI circular clearly confirms the right to do business with crypto firms,” said Avinash Shekhar, co-Chief Executive Officer at ZebPay, India’s oldest crypto exchange. He added that the clarification will attract more investors to the virtual currencies.

The RBI’s broader concerns and banks’ worries around money laundering should help to spur regulations and make the industry safer and stronger, said Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was little changed as of 12:15 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, after having gained in the two previous sessions.

It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!

Moving on to Factor ETFs,

2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.

3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.

4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.

5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.

6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles ""quality"" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for ""profitability"", ""solvency and financial risk"", and ""earnings quality"".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.

Let us not forget commodities,

7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and ""flat"" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.

8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.

Seeking dividends?

9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.

Finally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,

10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.

Disclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).

After looking over tons of historical data and running through every scenario that could result in a:

1. Rapid and sudden increase in the value of the contracts as the underlying security increase in price at a rate previously unmatched within 5 years but prior to then this rate of change was a common or repeating occurrence.
2. A sudden change in the availability of a crucial commodity that is produced by the company when generating profit
3. The value of the company should be reflected by the reserves that are profitable to extract at prices higher than current commodity prices but lower that previous highs.
4. Storage of the raw and refined commodity is both impractical and expensive on a large scale
5. Regulatory, Tax and Consumer Preferences have a major impact on the availability of the good
6. A shortage of the good would result in widespread economic and financial losses but is hard to predict and impossible to prevent
7. Market fragmentation geographically, along the value chain and volatile changes in liquidity of investment vehicles.
8. A short squeeze or rapid transfer of capital to the long side of a stock to prevent losses from bears .
9. A weak share price over the last few years to help justify the reduction in holdings for non financial reasons (ESG)
10. A sharp drop in share price owing to very temporary news
11. No/unreasonably small increase in the cost of similar options with longer durations and or closer to the money strike prices
12. Contracts that cost less than $0.10 that could be exercised for a profit in less than a week of steady gains equal to 1/3 the average daily price move
13. Focus on absolute changes in value over the relative changes in value that would result from different commodities influencing the demand for each other and what would cause the relationship to become decoupled or distorted
14. Commodities with a high number of end uses but a low number of alternative goods.
15. Unhedged, dirty beta and less than liquid are desirable only if there is a below average number of market participants.
16. There should be clear indications of shortages in some regions or countries.
17. China will need it to fuel growth in the future.
18. There is always significant arb opportunities but they are hard to capture
19. Under no circumstances could a new technology or innovation disrupt the market for this commodity in the near-mid future
20. A high barrier to entry and limited number of quality companies in the industry.

**Current Examples: BTE July and June Calls 1.5 Strike picked up at 15 cents.**

Look at my post history:  The numbers don't lie and **BIR**, TK, DBA calls have been major gains.

I studied energy infrastructure in China and spoke to officials in the government overseeing energy legislation. I interviewed the top commentators and public + private fund managers. I have 5 papers and a ton of reports to back up my FA. Empirical evidence mounting and market validation up the wazooo.

**Spoiler Alert**: Natural Gas and Condensate producers are priced as if they will rise in a linear and predictable way that mirrors their 5 year downward trend caused by an event that cannot be replicated to the extent it was 5 years ago.

I have waited until a significant number of these experimental trades have been executed and studied by myself in an open and transparent process involving me making posts in communities on the internet including this forum outlining the opportunity and specific rational for that contract. So far the average position size of $122.5 USD has returned $660.00 dollars net of tcosts and borrowing fees over a period of 1 year.

2 contracts have expired worthless and only one of them was never ITM. Why do electricity and nat gas prices SPIKE when expressed as the share price of ETPs employing a VIX like rolling of  (constant maturity futures)? The inability to store the physical commodity in order to offset the risk of delivering a future contract at a price many times higher than both spot and long dated contracts cannot be mitigated for volatility, gas and electricity  like with other commodities.

In a 2018 study by Avellaneda and Papanicolaou the VIX volatility skew and tail size compared to that only of other commodities that can not be stored and distributed easily (electricity and nat gas).

Partial backwardation periods for Nat Gas are common during severe weather events and create periods where the spot price rises well above the long term average price. A temporary rise in commodity price is enough to generate a slightly delayed and less significant, but both in absolute/relative terms large enough to cause the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the calls to more than double in addition to premiums for hedges to increase as well.

Because the lower liquidity of natural gas derivatives, hedging using longer dated futures as opposed to options is far more common and retail investors can take advantage by needing less liquidity to hedge long positions in small cap stocks and realize gains by exercising or selling the calls.

The time decay is offset by several unique characteristics. The first consideration is the ability of the natural gas producer to lock in sales at peak prices due to the extreme social and economic cost of forgoing electricity generation using gas turbines and diverting residential heating fuel. This means selling cash secured puts and exercising some calls with the residual risk capital left over from subtracting the cost of buying the calls from the return. The long term change in retained earnings and book value of the company will prevent a mean reversion in the stock price following the spot prices rapid correction. The common shares left over then become ideal for CC writing and selling cash secured puts while IV is high but new earnings and sticky commodity prices help prop up share prices.

The importance lies in timing of buying of options contracts designed to cost small amounts of premium over time, in exchange for a return on investment that is many times the value of expired contracts. During periods of very low volatility, purchasing the majority of OTM and longer dated contracts gives the ability to max the return on capital due to gamma and the lower marginal cost increases when buying longer dated contracts."|investing|Fat Tail Distributions and Hunting Dirty Beta Plays|17.0|0.81

Here are my thoughts:

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 32.9B. $FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 2.9B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...

Peloton’s trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. Again $FRX soon to be $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. That’s plenty of upside for the short term.

Long term they are projected to hit 3.3B by 2025. With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes, Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up. Plus, they will have a marketing war chest (400M+ in cash if I remember correctly from an interview) after the merger to achieve their growth target.

Beachbody has also been profitable for the 18 of the last 20 years they’ve been in business. Unlike many other SPACs and growth companies they’ve proven they can generate income.

Once all aspects of their NEW business model come together, they will be able to sell the equipment, the subscriptions, and nutrition supplements directly on their platforms. Imagine completing an interactive workout from the bike and being able to purchase all your nutritional supplements directly from the screen with a few taps.

Each customer acquired will mean much more revenue than strictly subscriptions can bring in alone.

Are you buying? What are your reasons for and against the Beachbody, MYX Fitness, and FRX three-way merger?

Scientists say the system could be used to find ‘hidden gems’ of research overlooked by other methods, and even to guide decisions on funding allocations so that it will be most likely to target promising research....

The researchers then used the system to correctly identify 19 of the 20 ’seminal’ biotechnology papers from 1980 to 2014 in a blinded study, and to select another 50 papers published in 2018 that they predict will be among the top 5% of ‘impactful’ biotechnology research papers in the years to come....

‘We don’t expect to be able to identify all foundational technologies early,’ Weis says. ‘Our hope is primarily to find technologies that have been overlooked by current metrics.’

As I think about this more, the deal has become more appealing. It is easy to see how they could mess up everything along the way, but the valuation is pretty reasonable and doesn't seem to factor in a lot of the upside potential that could be captured here. Let me know if I am missing anything glaringly obvious w/ the merger calc (imgur snippet)-

* Revenue is extremely conservative.
* EBITDA margins for the two co's separately are around 30%, so I'm not even sure where Management's big synergy assumptions are being plugged in. If anyone understand this let me know. It seems very conservative.
* NWC held at 15%, above the historical \~10% of the two separate Co's.
* Debt set to be paid back to target 42b in 2023, and then held at 3x EBITDA.
* Interest set at 3.0%, as mentioned in Malone interview.
* Capex set at 4b/yr, above depreciation, which is set to historical average of both Co's 5% of revenue. This 4b/yr over five years equals the 20b management is planning to spend.
* The deal won't close until mid-late-2022, so you could factor in some delay in the model for this. I did not do that.
* Terminal set at 20x free cash flow to equity.
* IRR = +20%.

So, just to catch anyone up who is just joining:

Hertz filed for bankruptcy. 

Turns out they were not that bankrupt.

Everybody is getting made whole except for the shareholders.

Shareholders of Class 11 stock that pre-pandemic traded at $20 (now trading $6) are getting bought out.

The payout is in three parts:

1) Cash in the amount of $1.53 per share, plus 

2) Pro Rata shares of (a) 3% of the Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests (estimated to be $1 per share), plus

**3) Either:**

**a) 30-year warrants for 18% of the equity in the Reorganized Debtors struck at an equity value of $6.5 billion, or**

**b) rights to participate in a $1.635 billion offering for approximately 35% of Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests at a per share price based on a total equity value of approximately $4.7 billion. (Subscription Rights)**

This post is a ""deep dive""/""open discussion"" of the third portion above in bold.

**a) 30-year warrants -** waiting for confirmation. It is believed that these warrants have a strike price of $10. So, an example would be a Warrant is issued with a strike price of $10. New Hertz shares are trading at $15 per share. Warrants can be sold or executed. If sold, warrants typically sell for market price less strike price. So, each warrant would be worth $5. Add to the cash of $1.53 + the equity distribution of $1. Total value $7.53.

**b) Subscription rights -** there are 2 types of subscription rights

**1) Eligible Shareholder** \- accredited investors and institutions. Look it up yourself if you don't know if you are. But basically, you must be a broker, bank or have a net cash worth of $1,000,000.

**2) Ineligible Shareholder** \- everybody else. Probably 99% of the people reading this post.

**What I know about subscription rights:**

Basically, what I learned today is that you can participate in an auction prior to the conclusion of the bankruptcy for share in the new company. 

If you are an Eligible shareholder, you can enter a maximum auction price. If the auction goes above the price you set, then you do not purchase any shares.

If you are an Ineligible shareholder, you can enter a minimum auction price. If the auction does not get to the price you set, you automatically are issued New Warrants in the Hertz.

*Actual language below.*

**Item 9. Election Form for Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to sell its Subscription Rights pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Minimum Auction Price”) 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights 

To calculate the maximum number of Subscription Rights that an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder may elect to sell, an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder should multiply the number of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds by 1.0467. 

Note: If you are an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to have your Pro Rata share of the Shareholder Subscription Rights sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction described below, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return this form. 

**Item 10. Election Form for Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to purchase Subscription Rights (if any) pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Maximum Auction Price”) 

Up to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights

Note: If you are an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to purchase Shareholder Subscription Rights that may be sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return an election.

BarkBox is a spac that today approved the merger. The Ticker $stic will be $bark on June 2nd.

Many of these subscription box companies get a bad reputation because there were so many grocery ones that lose billions for years and the pet ones made no money because all they did was get existing products and package them where the margins were horrible. 

Nevertheless, barkbox is different. They own all of the products they put in the box, we call that vertically integrated. Have a retail store and sell the products at target and other online and offline stores. So, given the higher Margins, vertical integration, new revenue channels and fast growth I think the valuation should be more expensive than chewy on a price to sales multiple. Lets not discount that the subscription model will evolve over time churn is around 5% to 6% which is excellent. 

The company actually has a few revenue channels: 

buy subscription (you can customize as well), 

add on products to the box, 

dental (medical and preventative is new and will grow), 

meal plan (sends you monthly box of daily meals; crazy but people/dogs can be picky about food), 

ecommerce/retail where they sell the products on amazon, pet stores etc. this is an interesting business because it is not just ecommerce or subscription because they own a lot of the products they sell as their brand where they have exclusive supplychain and distribution agreements. They also have licensing with plush toys with NBA (example). They realized customers are crazy and treat dogs like people so do stuff accordingly. 

No doubt they will sell clothes, costumers, more medical stuff like fleak tick products to help keep the customes within the ecosystem. 

The ceo is actually new started in september 2020 and has options priced at $16 a share. He came from amazon and ebay and before that consultant at infosys. I think the management hire was an excellent decision as it allows then to scale their ecommerce business and get new customers into the ecosystem via subscriptions or not. I see the subscription revenue as potentially amazon prime stuff where people will just fill it up with what they need and not just junk all the time and people will be happy with that and some add-ons here and there. 

The pet business is a fantastic long-term business as boomers age, etc. strategy for this is to buy and either hold or sell when it hits $20 to $30 if there becomes too much hype. This range of valuation is based in Price to Sales. The bottom I used was 2 times given Its growth rate and almost double the gross margin of chewy and even pet supermarket stores. The guidance for this year has room for upside 

I built a ten year model and see then becoming profitable by 2023, however, all of their cash flow is going into growing the business as I think they can sustain a 30% revenue per year for a few years. I do think there are some potential risks such that the Barkeats business could do poorly if the pricing is not competitive or people change the product mix of the box to less profitable products or cancel all together.

The problem I've run up against is that, when the market dumps, everything seems to dump together - in other words, assets that didn't seem correlated or were inversely correlated sometimes become strongly correlated when the market is doing poorly, thus sort of defeating some of the protective intent of diversify through non-correlated assets. 

According to your experience, is there any way around this, statistically speaking? Are there different correlation tests that you've found to be more effective for diversification? Is it perhaps best to invest in newer assets in price discovery mode, or to invest broadly by small amounts in any assets that have been least affected by market-wide downturns in the past?

Their app and website don’t even have any language other than Simplified Chinese. However, it is a public company listed in the US stock market. Pinduoduo an e-commerce platform. It offers a suite of product categories just like Amazon and Walmart in the US.

**The Numbers Seem Impossible Yet It is**

**We do believe whatever in the 26 May, 2021 quarterly financial report is definitely real. However, even we do believe it is real, still it raises some concerns to the company.**

***We do assume no one is using Pinduoduo outside China.***

**The User Numbers**

It stated that the average monthly active users in the quarter was 724.6 million. Also, the monthly active users refers to the number of user accounts that visited the Pinduoduo mobile app during a given month, which does not include those that accessed the platform through social networks and access point.

Active buyers on Pinduoduo in the 12-month period ended March was about 824 million. Active buyers refers to the number of user accounts that placed one or more orders, regardless of whether the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.

However, let’s compare some well known e-commerce companies in China. Alibaba has 811 million active buyers, and JD has 499 million active buyers. The last two definitely have more people know outside or within China. Even a lesser know Meituan has 510.6 million paying users and you do see their delivery bicycles on every street in China. They are also all having much longer history than Pinduoduo.

What is the concept of 824 million in China alone, let’s quote the Chinese Official data.

Chinese netizens have 898 million in 2020. The internet availability rate was 70.4%. A total of 986 million Chinese used mobile phones to surf the internet, accounting for 99.7 percent of the online population. Around 309 million, or 31.3% of the online population, live in rural areas.

Which means more than 90% people in China who have internet access are using Pinduoduo and made a purchase on the website or the app within this 12 month period. It included part of those those around 300 million people who lived in rural areas and there monthly salary is less than $2000 RMB ($314).

**Underweight**

**We are not by any means questioning the authenticity of the report, we do believe it is real.**

However, there would not be a huge growth rate for Pinduoduo active users. The average revenue per user is just one-fifth of Alibaba’s because Pinduoduo targets the lower end users, and the way they attract users is by giving them a subsidiary (coupons or cash equivalent) to keep their products price lower than other e-commerce platform. That’s just like burning money no matter which way you see it. It can be doing that forever. Because of that, many big brands are hesitant, if not, unwilling to open an official online flagship store in Pinduoduo.

* Valuation Change (P/E or P/B re-pricing)
* Earnings Growth (increase in EPS)
* Dividend Yield

Have been pondering this some time since rates were dropped down to zero last year. With rates close to zero and future increases being negative for bond prices, why wouldn't it make sense to take some money out of bonds and place it into financially healthy blue chips with reasonable (but not too high) dividends? 

By ""financially healthy"" I would typically include dividend yield between 2%-4%, payout ratio below 50% or 60%, debt to equity below 1 or preferably below 0.75,  free cash flow margin above 10%, and a solid cash balance (can't get very specific since it varies heavily by industry). These attributes typically apply to large/megacap stocks so that wouldn't be a requirement but it'd usually fit the bill. 

My thinking is that rates being at 0% negatively affect bonds in two ways: lower yield (10 year treasury is about 1.6% right now) and less upside as prices will get dinged when rates inevitably rise. Another point is that bonds underperform during bouts of inflation although that's another conversation entirely. I know that equities are obviously more volatile during recessionary periods but with so much of the upside of bonds stripped away I don't see why this wouldn't be a decent strategy as long as rates are low. 

What would some downsides be to this strategy? From a portfolio management standpoint  Would love to hear additional opinions, particularly risks that I haven't mentioned here."|investing|Replacing bonds with blue chips yielding 2%-4%|33.0|0.84

&gt;Here’s how the company did:

&gt;* Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
* Revenue: $228.9 million, vs. $212.9 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

&gt;Revenue grew 110% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 30, according to a statement. In the previous quarter revenue increased by 117%. The company’s net loss swelled to $203.2 million from $93.6 million.

&gt;For the full 2022 fiscal year Snowflake called for $1.020 billion to $1.035 billion in product revenue, which at the middle of the range implies 86% growth and is more than the $1.02 billion FactSet consensus.

I don’t think it’s particularly much of a secret, but just hear me out. They tend to start up a small business operation for a while, and just run within their org. If things turn out well at the experimental stage, they invest hard and fast, through acquisition and/or expanding the operation rapidly.

I’m looking at some tidbits where they’re mentioning employee-internal health services, basically clinics with doctors and such.

It seems to me this is a classic R&amp;D effort inside a controlled environment. If they find they have a special sauce that could work in the marketplace, I would imagine there is going to be an announcement at one point where they’ll position a new Amazon product (whatever it’s going to be branded as, but I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if it was simply Amazon Health).

It’s an enormously profitable industry, it’s very hard to make inroads without serious capital and lobbying capacity, and Amazon has both. The incumbents have for the most part a pretty lousy customer experience, and between the software, the retail, and policy influence experience, I’d wager there is some serious potential. Add to this the currently heightened awareness about health care facilities and services.

I believe there is a 2 year time frame before there would be a significant announcement that would essentially put PPOs and HMOs on notice and make them sweat. There are plenty of successful boutique providers, small local hospitals, specialty clinics, a handful of franchises, but they’re all small scale. Acquiring a business that has the right real estate, and then implementing a health services model that allows people to get most ambulatory treatments without the enormous hassle, admin overhead, and time.... seems like a solid proposition in my book.

&gt;  
&gt;The success by activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 in getting at least two candidates on Exxon's board marks a big loss for the largest U.S. oil company, which incurred a $20 billion-plus loss in 2020 and has been slower to embrace lower-carbon investments than its global rivals. Exxon had sought to stave off investors aiming to reshape the board to better align the company with global moves to combat climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two of Engine No. 1's board nominees, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, were elected to Exxon's board, with counting continuing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The dissident shareholder group led by Engine No. 1 put up a slate of four nominees to the 12-member Exxon board of directors at the shareholder meeting in the first big boardroom contest at an oil major that makes climate change the central issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon has lagged other oil majors in its response to climate change concerns, forecasting many more years of oil and gas demand growth and doubling down on investments to boost its output - in contrast to global rivals that have scaled back fossil fuel investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;That approach boosted the company's debt load by billions of dollars in recent years, leading to a record $22 billion loss in 2020 after years of underperformance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Governments and companies have moved to reduce emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the planet, and investors led by Engine No. 1 have said the changing world meant that CEO Darren Woods needed to make big changes to ensure Exxon's future value to investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's a huge deal. It shows not just that there is more seriousness apparent in the thinking among investors about climate change, it's a rebuff of the whole attitude of the Exxon board,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director of ESG Research at MSCI.  
&gt;  
&gt;Woods had argued that Exxon's board understood the company's complexity and that Exxon supports a path toward carbon reductions in the Paris accord, referring to the international agreement aimed at combating climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, in another signal of investor dissatisfaction with the company's approach to climate change, shareholders also approved measures calling on Exxon to provide more information on its climate and grassroots lobbying efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Engine No. 1 successfully rallied support from institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms upset with Irving, Texas-based Exxon for its weak financial performance in recent years. It has just a $50 million stake in Exxon, which carries a market value of nearly $250 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;BlackRock Inc [**(BLK.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BLK.N), Exxon’s second-largest shareholder, [**joined the dissidents**](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-blackrock-backs-three-director-nominees-challenging-exxons-board-2021-05-25/), as it will support three of Engine No. 1′s nominees, Reuters reported on Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon had fought to keep climate activists at bay, spending tens of millions of dollars on a high-profile PR campaign, agreeing to publish more details of its emissions and coming out in support of carbon reduction. Activists have said it is too little, too late, and that Exxon needs a less reactive strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This proxy fight reflects this broad change in how our political leaders, our business leaders and our fellow shareholders are stepping up and taking these immense risks seriously,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The state's pension fund in April said it backed Engine No. 1's slate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exxon shares were up 0.9% in Wednesday trading, rising modestly after the announcement. The stock has lagged its peers over the last five years.

&gt; The MGM deal is Amazon’s second largest in its history, after its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017. Whole Foods in 2017 reported around $16 billion in revenue in 2017, the same year MGM reported $1.3 billion in revenue. Those numbers, along with the fact that analysts valued MGM at $5.5 billion in December 2020, shows just how valuable the studio’s assets are for Amazon’s plan to touch nearly every part of its customers’ lives through Prime.

Could it be that Tesla expectations of dominance are subtracting from the expected returns of these car companies? I am looking at Toyota for example, who were the early leaders in electric tech and are now focusing on a large new range of ev’s. Could TM be a great buy if I think they will catch up on the ev tech?

Lastly, with the expected switch to greener tech, any thoughts on silver? I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode, but I would love other investors opinions. Reasons for silver: 
Decreased supply: mined silver per year has been decreasing and it is very difficult to find silver mines (most silver is a by product from other mines). 
Increased demand: Green tech (eg solar panels and electric cars). Also increased investor focus (silver squeeze movement plus it is a traditional inflation hedge)
Silver has got a bad name due to some etfs like SLV not being backed by physical silver, but PSLV is legit (or I prefer buying it from my local coin store and keeping it in my possession)

Edit: My real question probably should be worded as: if Tesla is a bubble and they won’t take over everything, is this an opportunity for other car manufacturers.

For example, let’s use $STEM. Institutional ownership is at 11% and institutional transactions is at -52.31%. I understand that institutions own 11% of the shares. Does the institutional transactions number of -52.31% reflect institutions selling 52.31% of their shares (or total shares?) over a set period of time? I.e., “52.31% decrease in shares owned over the last week”, or “over the last 24 hours”, etc? I can’t help but feel like I misunderstand the metric for that one.

Related question: Any idea how often these values are updated? Of course some of the numbers are essentially real-time, but I’d imagine this value (inst. own./trans.) requires some reporting/tabulating.

# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

And furthermore ""inflation is now again the biggest risk for markets,"" as initially identified by 35% of the survey's 194 respondents who manage a combined $592 billion worth of assets. But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&amp;P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight. And despite folks arguing that recent upticks in price represent ""transitory"" concerns and ""reopening quirks,"" this debate is likely to rage on for months especially as high-profile skeptics sound alarms.

On paper, it seems pretty solid. It's a conglomerate of British Airways and Iberian Airways (the crown jewels of British and Spanish governments), and a few other budget and smaller-cap airlines. 

As far as I can tell, the only reason it hasn't risen is because European nations have had a much more difficult time recovering travel-wise. Different restrictions to countries, as well as the British government putting the United States on the red-list because of a high COVID danger, means that they can't generate as much revenue. 

I'm trying to understand what investors aren't seeing in ICAGY that they saw in companies like Jetblue and United?

In my search, I found a company called Arbor, which is a REIT with a very juicy dividend yield (7.86%). Usually, dividend yields this high are when the company stock falls due to a bad future outlook, and it's expected that the company might have to cut its dividends soon, but that's not the case here — $ABR has been steadily growing for years. 

I tried to read a bit more about this company, but I feel like I'm lacking the knowledge to understand what's it doing to be growing so much. It's a REIT that specializes in mortgages, but I thought this kind of stuff got less popular after 2008? Is it super risky?

It's not discussed very much on the internet, most articles I saw about it seem auto-generated from templates and mostly about the stock price (like [this one](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-arbor-realty-trust-abr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2021-03-17)). 

Some more useful info I found:

- [comparison of mREITs](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398102-you-are-considering-mortgage-reits-you-must-read-this) on seeking alpha which does not discuss Arbor much, but other mREIT stocks it mentions (like $STWD, $BXMT, $ACRE, and $LADR) while having similar yield, don't have similar stock price growth;
- [this Q1 2021 call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/07/arbor-realty-trust-abr-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/) that I read but couldn't understand much of the terms used there. GSE? AIR? build-to-rent?

Have you ever heard of the Norwegian State Fund?  No?  Not only is it the largest fund in the world, but it is also considered one of the most cleverly managed.  He has built a huge fortune from virtually nothing through constant, low-risk investing.  His strategy has proven itself over various market cycles and can certainly be a blueprint for private investors.  But how exactly did this come about and what has the fund done right in the past?

The story began in the 1960s when oil was first found off the coast of Norway.  From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  It only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil."|investing|Invest like the Norwegian Oil Fund|810.0|0.93

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!"|investing|$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.|7.0|0.66

This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC."|investing|Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?|162.0|0.85
1621604216.0|0.0|t3_nhspuq|12.0|"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/oatly-is-said-to-price-ipo-at-top-of-range-with-markets-slumping

Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY."|investing|Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO|67.0|0.89

&gt;Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

&gt;The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

&gt;Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

&gt;The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

&gt;To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement &amp; Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President &amp; CEO of DDC."|investing|Drone Delivery Canada selected by UBC for remote communities delivery initiative|36.0|0.8

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years."|investing|Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?|3205.0|0.83

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&amp;#x200B;

1621369544.0|0.0|t3_nfl8th|19.0|"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

&gt;“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

&gt;“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
&gt;  
&gt;“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
&gt;  
&gt;“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

&gt;“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

&gt;“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

&gt;“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

&gt;“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

&gt;“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

&gt;“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

&gt;“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

&gt;“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

&gt;“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  
&gt;  
&gt;And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

So the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions."|investing|Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)|19.0|0.76

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&amp;P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&amp;P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results.

&gt;How are things at the $2 billion deli?

&gt;&gt;Hometown International, the mystifying New Jersey deli company that is valued at nearly $100 million on the stock market — despite running just a single deli — has ousted its CEO, according to a financial filing. 

&gt;&gt;Paul Morina, a local high school principal and renowned wrestling coach in the area, was removed after a vote by majority shareholders, according to the late Friday filing.

&gt;&gt;Morina owns about 1.5 million shares of the Paulsboro-based company, which are worth more than $18.5 million based on the company’s current stock price. 

&gt;&gt;Shareholders of the company also ousted the company’s only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works in her day job with Morina as an administrator at Paulsboro High School.

&gt;Here is the filing, from last Friday. It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:

&gt;&gt;On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. 

&gt;But he still runs the deli:

&gt;&gt;Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.

&gt;See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.

&gt;The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.

&gt;Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.

1621350044.0|0.0|t3_nfcxdz|54.0|"**Deal Structure:**

The deal will be carried out in the form of the Reverse Morris Trust, which implies spinning off WarnerMedia into a separate company, let's call it NewCo (no official name yet), which will then merge with Discovery. As a result of the transaction, the share of the current AT&amp;T shareholders in the new company will be 71%, and 29% of NewCo will be held by the current shareholders of Discovery. AT&amp;T will receive $ 43 billion from the NewCo in return for the transfer of media assets (WarnerMedia) to NewCo. The structure of the transaction (Reverse Morris Trust) will eliminate the need for AT&amp;T to pay income tax on the transfer of assets.

**Debt:**

The new company will own WarnerMedia, Discovery's current business, but it will immediately have $ 58 billion in debt ($ 43 billion from AT&amp;T and $ 15 billion from Discovery). WarnerMedia and Discovery's combined EBITDA in 2020 was $ 12 billion (expected to grow to $ 14 billion by 2023). I would like to point out a negative point right away. At the close of the deal, the leverage of the new company will be 4.83x. However, the company plans to cut it to 3x by 2023. High leverage of NewCo, as well as uncertainty about NewCo's valuation, caused a correction in Discovery shares on this news. Management also expects operating synergies of $ 3 billion per year from the merger.

**Revenue and FCF:**

Discovery's revenue for 2020 is $ 10.4 billion, WarnerMedia's revenue was $ 30.4 billion. Total revenue for 2020 for the two companies is $ 40.8 billion. The new WarnerMedia &amp; Discovery entity is projected to produce roughly $8.4 billion in free cash flow if you follow the free cash flow conversion guidance given in the announcement.

**Valuation:**

If you do the math, taking the share ownership of 71% AT&amp;T holders and 29% Discovery holders and base the valuation of the new entity on the $43 billion price for Discovery's 29%, you get a total value for the new entity of roughly $105 billion or 12.5 times projected free cash flow of $8.4 billion.

Let's take multipliers for the entire media sector. The sector average EV / S multiplier is 4.38, excluding Netflix, the multiplier is 3.31. Netflix has the highest multiplier in this sector (8.6), which affects the calculation of the average multiplier in our sample. I take the EV / S multiple since the spread in the EV / EBITDA multiple is even more significant. Accordingly, 3.31 will be the lower bound of our estimate, and 4.38 will be the upper bound. The Enterprise Value range will then be from $ 135 to $ 179 billion. The market value of the new company will be equal to EV minus debt, that is, $ 77- $ 121 billion. The fair value of the Discovery share is $ 22.3-35 billion. vs current $16-18B (depends on the series DISCA/DISCK/DISCB), a 25-45% upside.

**What analyst say:**

* BofA estimates the combination is worth about $148B in enterprise value; correspondingly, it's staying Neutral on DISCA with a price target of $40 (now 22% upside from current price).
* Deutsche Bank calls the deal a ""clear positive"" for Discovery, and says it helps AT&amp;T get back to core distribution. From Discovery's perspective, this is ""the deal we hoped they could get done"" and it should be highly effective in driving DTC subscriber and revenue growth at home and abroad.
* Bank of America estimates the new Discovery/WarnerMedia entity to be worth approximately $148 billion enterprise value. This attributes a 13.5x multiple to 2030E direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) discounted back and a 7.0x multiple on CY22E legacy OIBDA. When applying Discovery's 29% stake, this equates to an implied Discovery share price range of $39-42/share.

**Share classes:**

As for Discovery share classes, the spread is narrowing (between nonvoting DISCK to DISCA, to 7% from 15%). So now that the arbitrage is over DISCA should be going up along with DISCK. Not sure how DISCK will move - better avoid it as it's x2 of DISCA/DISCK and once the vote passes it may collapse...

Thoughts?

I'm a DISCA holder -&gt; correction -&gt; after much thought and investigation you should own DISCK.

DISCA and DISCK are common shares and the only difference is that DISCA has voting rights. Since the company is merging with another there is no voting value, and value of DISCA slowly erode while DISCK come closer until DISCA=DISCK. Currently there is a difference of 7% between them, so you can get this as well.

CPI spike in 2021 is likely “transitory” as suggested by the Fed, due to economic reopening and supply chain constraints caused by last year. We are also still far from full employment and the tech driven deflationary forces are not going away.

Also keep in mind that the current ongoing inflation is procyclical: prices in the US have risen rapidly because the economy reopened rapidly. This is not the same as the countercyclical inflation of 1970s. Over the past 30 years, the SP500 has performed most strongly during periods of rising growth and rising procyclical inflation.

&gt; Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election.

A little surprising to me given the recent IPO and the fact that they trade below ipo reference price ($250, current close is 248.24, ~3% additional drop after market on these news). I still feel investment in $COIN presents an interesting way to expose oneself to crypto without actually holding crypto (and the whole “sell the pickaxes in the gold rush”). At the same time I’m guessing pressure is mounting and their fat margins might not be staying there for long so they will need to try to scale as much as possible."|investing|Coinbase announced a $1.25B private offering|75.0|0.86

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well? Basically, all else being equal, simply from a growth point of view, which is better to hold when interest rates go up? Or are there just too many variables to consider (how much interest rates go up, how quickly, and for how long they're expected to stay at that level)?"|investing|When interest rates go up, do stocks and bonds get hit the same?|22.0|0.76

BASIC COMPANY INFORMATION

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defence company which provides very high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the air force comes from this one company.

CEO INFORMATION

Lockheed recently announced in 2020 a new CEO to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet .While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company I might add).

DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS

Quarterly Payout (At A Glance)
2020 - $2.60
2019 - $2.40
2018 - $2.20
2017 - $2.00
2016 - $1.82
2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = ~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY  profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&amp;P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company has a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/stock-information/dividend-history

MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS

The company has a long history of M&amp;A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year. 

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about ~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/balance-sheet/

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/cash-flow?p=LMT

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT

GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for  the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forcasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and badder weapons. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY

If you were given 10 million dollars, and your goal was to create a globally recognized soda brand, could you get it done? Maybe. What about 10 million to create a social media platform? Also a maybe. But could you start a aeronautics and/or defence company with 10 million budget? Absolutely not.

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of ~13.9. This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in. 

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT

RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defence budget.

**Why TKC?**

So I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&amp;name=small)

**About the company**

So the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).

**Financials**

I don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.

[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)

[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)

Their net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.

**Possible things that may drive the value up.**

I already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.

Another thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.

Lastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.

**One important thing that caught my eye**

Last month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**

**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**

As I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**

Another thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

I believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone. But even with those risks, I dont think it will devaluate more at this point."|investing|Turkcell Communication Services ($TKC), why you should/shouldn't invest in it.

- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. 
- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.


**UID 2.0** 
- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. 
- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? 

**Current Problem** 
- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. ""Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?""

- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to ""protect"" their customers, which is true to an extent. 

**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** 
- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.
 
**How it Works** 

**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)
**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once
**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. 
**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers 
**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. 
**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. 

**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those ""Walled Gardens""?** 

- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*
- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) 

**Solimar** 

- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)
- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers 
- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar 

**Koa AI** 
- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you’re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.

- ""Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. Building that off-site data into Solimar, whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals."" - Jeff Green

- He explains it better than I could
 
- Solimar helps solve the problem of media marketers who have big plates to fill and who are running massive campaigns. 
- Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&amp;T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

&gt;Billionaire George Soros’s investment firm snapped up shares of **ViacomCBS**, **Discovery** and **Baidu** as they were being sold off in massive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros Fund Management bought $194 million of **ViacomCBS Inc.**, **Baidu Inc.** stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of **Vipshop Holdings Ltd.** and $34 million of **Tencent Music Entertainment Group** during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing released Friday. A person familiar with the fund’s trading said the company didn’t hold the shares prior to Archegos’s implosion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros also increased its bet on **Amazon.com Inc.** and homebuilder **DR Horton Inc.**, which is now its second-largest public equity position.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 13F, which money managers overseeing more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file quarterly, revealed that Soros held $4.5 billion of U.S. equities, down $77 million from the prior quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest exit in the quarter was **Palantir Technologies Inc.** Soros sold 18.5 million shares valued at about $435 million. The firm originally revealed it owned a stake in the controversial data-mining company controlled by Peter Thiel in November, but rapidly issued a statement saying the original investment was made in 2012 and it regretted the decision.

That company is AT&amp;T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities &amp; challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&amp;T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&amp;T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&amp;T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&amp;T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&amp;T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&amp;T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&amp;T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&amp;T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&amp;T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&amp;T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&amp;T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&amp;T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&amp;T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&amp;T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

The outperformance of PSLDX is pretty clear. I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. 

I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016)

Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.

[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)

You'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&amp;P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&amp;P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&amp;P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. 

The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. 

It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  

I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. 

Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it's more complex than a simple passive ETF."|investing|S&amp;P 500, Realty Income, and S&amp;P 500 Long Duration|21.0|0.81

Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&amp;A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.  I find it weird that these mods can just post their OPINION on these threads and state it as if it is a FACT.

&gt;“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we were to see an ongoing 10% correction in the MSCI China over the next quarter or so,” John Woods, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at Credit Suisse Group AG, [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-05-12/likely-correction-in-equities-over-summer-credit-suisse-s-woods-video) Bloomberg TV on May 12, citing increased regulatory intervention as a top concern. “This is weighing on the extremely important tech sector.”

Say what you want about Seeking Alpha, but this writer is generally considered the most analytical author there and in no way limits her team's work to Seeking Alpha. I notice some people don't like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.

The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.

Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn't dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn't feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.

She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn't delve very far into the thought.

My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. 

""Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.""

""Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.""

""Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.""

""Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.""

""Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.
My base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.""

These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as ""inflation,"" so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. 

I hate precious metals since I don't really think of them as hard assets--it's just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. 

I'd also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.

It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.

I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don't worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won't be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth."|investing|Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends|48.0|0.91
1621019470.0|0.0|t3_ncgfqa|18.0|"Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.

Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.

Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.

James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.

The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.

By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 

March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""

Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued."|investing|Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March Data|18.0|0.86

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy &amp; hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

1620975834.0|0.0|t3_nc2i7c|38.0|"Wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the upcoming Exxon annual vote that's being contested by a group called Engine No 1? They are seeking to break up the current board and vote in 4 of their own candidates in order to push the company into a greener direction. To grab a quote off their [website](https://reenergizexom.com/), ""ExxonMobil lacks a plan to create shareholder value in a world that seeks to decarbonize"".

I'm not really a seasoned investor, but I generally agree that Exxon stock has been underperforming for years partly because of increased demand and feasibility of cleaner energy, and the end of the petroleum energy's dominance is encroaching (we're inevitably going to run out of the stuff). The only ""green"" move by Exxon has been to invest heavily in carbon capture and storage; which is fine, but I'd like to see Exxon soon put together a solid plan to gradually transition out of strictly petroleum and get more involved in wind, solar, and other renewables - I'm most likely being really naive here.

In theory I like Engine No 1's objective but I guess my main concern is how effective or sincere they would be in their push for green and cleaner energy? Maybe they're just some investment firm using all this as an opportunity to place their own members on Exxon's board who'll just cash in and ultimately won't fulfill their stated objectives? I honestly don't know, and Engine No 1 probably won't get the votes they're looking for anyway. I'm anticipating that at some point I'm going to eventually divest from Exxon while putting more of my money into clean energy ETFs or something.

Anyone want to share their opinions or insights on any of this?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all for the comments and discussion. I'm learning a lot from everyone's input, not just about the outlook of oil production and oil companies in the coming years but also on how to approach these sort of contested votes as well. Much appreciation.

There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend over weeks either preceding or following earnings."|investing|A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs Coinbase, DoorDash, Bumble, Wish, and Coupang record all-time low stock prices this week|1316.0|0.96

Either to dampen volatility, provide something to rebalance against during the equity dips, improve risk-adjusted returns due to low correlations to lever an optimal portfolio...

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates)."|investing|The role of bonds in a portfolio|408.0|0.91

The Chinese population growth slowing is seen as a bad sign indicated by the decline in Alibaba stock price the day this was announced. However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number ([Yahoo!Finance](https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html), [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:~:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average))*^(Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in)*

**Risks**

Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com

Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns

Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.

**Note on investing in China**

A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don't like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn't make sense for China to do since they're trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.

In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html)) which would be counterproductive to the point above.

To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they're positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn't make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html))

**Conclusion**

Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba's growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren't over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they've shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.

**TLDR:** In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of \~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility."|investing|$BABA - Analysis for Alibaba after Earnings|109.0|0.91

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&amp;G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment."|investing|Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right direction|14.0|0.75

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stocks because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything."|investing|The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortage|123.0|0.88

Why?

Dealers had to keep 19.49% of the issued securities versus six month average at 24.2%

Direct buyers took 17.1% of the issued bonds versus six month average at 16.4%

Indirects (generally foreign investors) took 63.4% of the issued bonds versus the 59.4% six month average.

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is."|investing|Western Digital - The Next Nvidia|2.0|0.53

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”"|investing|Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’|43.0|0.79

&amp;nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&amp;P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&amp;nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&amp;P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&amp;nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&amp;nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&amp;nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/&gt;)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/&gt;)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/&gt;)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/&gt;)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&amp;nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

ABSRP beats it's category as the 2001 recession unfolds, but loses to PRNHX. Note that Cathie joined some time in 2001, so it's uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&amp;nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&amp;nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: -1.96%

-   VGT: 13.73%

-   IWF: 7.01%

-   PRNHX: 7.79%

&amp;nbsp;

**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

&lt;https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position&gt;

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible &amp; innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&amp;P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold &amp; wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett &amp; treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith &amp; Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&amp;W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia"|investing|The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow Rapidly|3.0|0.54
1620594296.0|0.0|t3_n8nkcd|525.0|"Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?"|investing|Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?|525.0|0.86

1620577266.0|0.0|t3_n8hkut|26.0|" Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up."|investing|Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)|17.0|0.76

Even the best companies will eventually die- surely it would be better to try and sell even stocks like AMZN and AAPL at some point rather than trying to hold them all the way until retirement and betting that they won’t decline before then. The problem, obviously, is trying to time the top, and if obvious signs of decline start to kick in, the market will certainly react.

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?"|investing|Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns|216.0|0.86

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&amp;P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya."|investing|Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls Shock|24.0|0.76

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&amp;P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&amp;P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,   Great &gt; 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats &amp; Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you."|investing|Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?|82.0|0.88

I was thinking to invest in the S&amp;P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&amp;P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&amp;D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&amp;P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY &amp; QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY &amp; QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY &amp; QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY &amp; QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

This article talks about the chip shortage which everyone has heard about by now. It says the chip shortage is going to affect everything, not just the new gaming consoles, but phones, automotive, your kitchen appliances, to even farming. It will take at least 2 years for companies to build new manufacturing plants, and while they believe everything should catch up to speed in 2 years, I'm thinking 3 years would be more likely. So what are your thoughts on investing during this time. I think everyone should expect a lot of losses during this time, but when supply finally meets demand, most of those losses should be wiped out and things will rebound from there.

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count &amp; effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&amp;P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner. Rant over."|investing|I sold every share I own today.|3946.0|0.89

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens &amp; Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens &amp; Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take."|investing|What Are Your PPE Manufacturer Plays?|194.0|0.83

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

1620264703.0|0.0|t3_n5w1a9|20.0|"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

1620235477.0|0.0|t3_n5lead|67.0|"For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&amp;#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&amp;#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them."|investing|Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)|67.0|0.9

&gt;  
&gt;Peloton recalled its Peloton Tread+ and Peloton Tread treadmills today, according to an [announcement from the Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the government agency that oversees most household products, citing safety hazards.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**The company also notified the CPSC that its newer Peloton Tread’s touch screen can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
&gt;  
&gt;The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.   
&gt;  
&gt;The treadmill’s safety risks first became apparent in March after [Peloton CEO John Foley wrote to](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-) users of the exercise machines regarding an incident with the Peloton Tread+ that led to the death of a child. Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.  
&gt;  
&gt;The widely publicized fatality prompted the CPSC to request information from Peloton, and the company disclosed to the agency that there were additional injuries and incidents tied to the Peloton Tread+.  
&gt;  
&gt;**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
&gt;  
&gt;The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families. I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

1620147449.0|0.0|t3_n4tc5v|0.0|"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish."|investing|Why You Should Short The Intel Fab Play|0.0|0.46

* We've had an enormous amount of growth in the US markets since the election
* There doesn't seem to be any more 'new' good news on the horizon, and the expected good news has already been priced in, hence stocks not moving much on superb earnings
* Hints/concerns/worries about central bank exit strategies (as well as can be predicted, i.e. no new variants causing unexpected problems)
* Lots of market euphoria and no more safe havens to hedge to with everything being expensive and treasuries potentially having zero expected future returns under some models - this is includes the possibility that US markets themselves are only at the valuations they are because there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to put cash for any kind of return

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&amp;P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&amp;P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&amp;P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?"|investing|Index funds or stock portfolio?|21.0|0.67

&gt;	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

&gt;	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

&gt;	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

&gt;	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

&gt;	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

&gt;	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

&gt;	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

&gt;	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

&gt;	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

&gt;	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

&gt;	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

&gt;	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

&gt;	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

&gt;	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

&gt;	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&amp;P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&amp;P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals.

It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped &gt;10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&amp;#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley &amp; Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&amp;P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock."|investing|This Barron's article might explain Tesla's sudden surge today: Tesla Stock Turns Higher Because Sales and Deliveries May Blow Away Estimates|918.0|0.91

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Quoting from Michael Pettis, who is always astute, and is a reasonably non-biased source on China's economy. [Read thread here](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1387831939353153537).

&gt;""Important article by [@Birdyword](https://twitter.com/Birdyword/), who discusses the shift from bank loans to buyers' deposits in the liabilities of Chinese property developers. As usual I'm especially interested in the balance-sheet impact: as long as things are going well, the shift barely matters, but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.  
&gt;  
&gt;This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.  
&gt;  
&gt;This process can be highly self-reinforcing as it forces property developers to cut back further on operations, and so alienate even more deposits. Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, Beijing will have to choose either to let households take the loss or to force banks to step in and make them whole. The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts &amp; notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation &amp; credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors."|investing|Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings|0.0|0.48

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods &amp; Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March &amp; September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA &amp; ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

In general I feel like economics is a completly shitty science(sorry). Yes, the financial markets/system is very complex, especially in combination with legislation, taxes etc. However I'm still in disbelief how bad designed the system is.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

I have been following this project for some time.  With the launch issues around Cyberpunk 2077, investors really beat it up, assuming the refunds would materially impact earnings, as a large % of revenue.  Well, it looks this has not been the case, considering.

Even after some much needed positive news, the stock seems stuck in this low ten's range.  Anyone have any other thoughts or opinions on an entry point here?

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”"|investing|Recent corporate executive comments on inflation|445.0|0.95

If true, this is a stupid move for Disney imo. There's no way in Canada to realistically order from their online store -- it requires payment in USD and there's a massive customs markup fee.

Their mall locations in and around Toronto have always been extremely popular and busy, often with lineups.

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -&gt; Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -&gt; Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-&gt; Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-&gt; Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook &amp; Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?
